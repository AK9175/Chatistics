Can we just mute this grp for ambassadors, and only keep the important messages and tasks. This creates a lot of confusion.

*Please DM me*
17/03/20, 12:31 pm - +91 89758 23894: Your phone will not detect the PDF because the URL you are using is a String object and not a PDF object. Technically, it should never open from the phone as PDF unless you download the PDF. PDF viewers on a phone only get activated once the Android OS tells them that it has a valid PDF file.
17/03/20, 2:13 pm - +91 77618 02234: I mean my own Android app

This may be a good time for many of us to start with the interview preparations, along with others in a collaborative and group study way.

We have decided to create an open source platform for peer learning  through which students can participate in live video interactions and solve DSA based questions/answers.

Also as this project is aimed at being open source, let us know if you want to be a part of the contribution team.

27/03/20, 12:36 pm - +91 94084 73852: 1st and 2nd rank from each college are getting scalar t-shirts , what about 3rd position ?
27/03/20, 12:36 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: nobody has gotten the goodies yet. because of the lockdown, i cant dispatch anything :( will dispatch ASAP, after April 15th
27/03/20, 12:37 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: good ideas! will share a form to collect all your suggestions
27/03/20, 12:37 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: would like to give you all things that you appreciate
27/03/20, 12:39 pm - Rishi Bajpai: Can we edit the address from home address to our college address now ?
Or the previously submitted form will be final ?
27/03/20, 12:40 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: no, nothing is final. 
- we would prefer to send to college addresses only, so that i can share winners' goodies along with your onboarding goodies. will dispatch when you all are back in campus. 
- please edit the addresses to your campus addresses.
27/03/20, 12:41 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: we will track how corona goes and alter the plan accordingly. but please know that you will 100% receive your goodies ASAP. I will be doing my best
27/03/20, 12:54 pm - +91 86004 69998: But i think giving our home address will be suitable bcz some campus securities didn't allow any outsiders like delivery guy to get them inn in that case this will create a mess for him and for us also and also if the situation arises that when we are busy with the lec and practicals then how they will contact to us...there are lots of issues related to that....For those who live in hostel that is good thing to mention campus address...plz look into it
27/03/20, 12:55 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: ah understood; will think about this and get back
27/03/20, 12:55 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: thanks aniket
27/03/20, 1:05 pm - +91 88305 03006: Good point, need to check wether our security allows couriers and packages
27/03/20, 1:45 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: yeah take your time and check. i'd like to dispatch when you all are in campus.
27/03/20, 1:46 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: but we can alter the plan based on covid
27/03/20, 1:46 pm - +91 91065 84241: campus isn't suitable for delivery
27/03/20, 1:46 pm - +91 91065 84241: Nobody outsiders are allowed in our campus
27/03/20, 1:46 pm - +91 78958 48767: Why?

19/04/20, 9:49 pm - +91 91679 73912: So if possible I would conduct data analysis in Python and if Time permit I'll create a tf model then you could use this for deployment
19/04/20, 9:49 pm - +91 91679 73912: Just a suggestion
19/04/20, 9:57 pm - +91 95606 78655: It's an advance topic, let's not go with advance topics for now!
19/04/20, 10:04 pm - +91 92052 56894: Umm according to me we should go for beginners level in the starting💯

Although we can do this ki jo bhi topics decided hai usmein Intermediate or expert level ka teach kare like if it's web D by Ayush toh he can teach the complex topics as well...✅

20/04/20, 11:24 am - +91 78148 84914: @919167973912 can you give your introduction. We all are here for Scaler Academy. But you are making your benefits?? Why we need to follow all those things. Yes, it's helpful but you know that what I'm saying?
20/04/20, 11:24 am - +91 78148 84914: What is this?
20/04/20, 11:28 am - +91 91679 73912: Sure so I am sujit from vivekanand college , Mumbai ..and as I had asked previously if people were interested in such contest and many of them wanted the info as there were lot of people and to reach out them individually was difficult I posted it here for the first days contest .. I understand that it's a group meant for scaler I also mentioned today that I won't be putting further updates of this event and people who are interested can follow the official handle.
And also jovianml is a datascience community..I don't get any credits for posting anything to it so it's non promotional.
Hope it helps

22/04/20, 2:07 pm - +91 98678 60524: Yes same question. Alot of people hesitate being added to a group without a motive, so if there is some upcoming activity we can use that to add them there, that would be helpful.

Otherwise I believe many of us are already parts of multiple groups which we use to promote Scaler activities!
22/04/20, 2:08 pm - +91 86004 69998: +1
22/04/20, 2:09 pm - +91 86004 69998: We are presently running lots of groups regarding studies,new tech trends and many things then what will be the purpose of this group

22/04/20, 2:26 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: without*
22/04/20, 2:26 pm - +91 78148 84914: Sir I created

22/04/20, 2:27 pm - +91 86004 69998: SO we are not creating right now because we are not having any fix intension for it
22/04/20, 2:28 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: yeah lets wait for a bit maybe. those of you who have already created, no problem! its not a big issue
22/04/20, 2:28 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: i'll leave the timing upto you, everyone
22/04/20, 2:28 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: you know best
22/04/20, 2:29 pm - +91 78148 84914: Sir, I also think same thing. People's are leaving.
22/04/20, 2:29 pm - +91 78148 84914: That's not good for us.
22/04/20, 2:29 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: hmm yes yes
22/04/20, 2:30 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: ok no problem, I'll fix this ASAP. for now, lets wait

22/04/20, 2:34 pm - +91 78148 84914: *Do one thing sir @919740166567 whatever banners, poster or every post you can add in our task and we have to share in our LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter & Facebook. This is good what I think? People's are getting to know. I think we have almost 315 + SAC and 1 SAC have 2000 followers (random I'm guessing) 315 × 2000 = 63,000. When we make WhatsApp group students think they are doing their advertisement which is bad for us. What do you say, Folks? Give your opinion?*
22/04/20, 2:39 pm - +91 86004 69998: Let's not use Linkedin  for Posters and banners,because it's a formal platform.We can  use Linkedin for creating awareness regarding any upcoming or ongoing competitions of Scaler Academy like the one which we all have done for "Discovery Challenge".What you all say guys?
22/04/20, 2:39 pm - +91 78148 84914: +1
22/04/20, 2:40 pm - +91 97174 36716: We can make a single group may be and extend it to several groups
Where only two or three sac's were admin @919560678655  and @919740166567  will admin of all
The impact of this is that we will successfully create a community which is interconnected
22/04/20, 2:40 pm - +91 97174 36716: Not seperate

22/04/20, 6:07 pm - +91 96604 10794: +1
22/04/20, 6:13 pm - +91 81041 50837: Thanks :)
22/04/20, 7:59 pm - +91 95606 78655: So this is an initiative to build a strong technical community, on campus. It will provide unique opportunities to learn and develop leadership skills, development, networking, mentoring, and bonding. We will be sharing webinars, opportunities, coding contests, and more in these groups. 

You as a Scaler Achiever are responsible for running these local communities on your campus, it's your choice to create a separate group and name it as Scaler Achiever Club or use an existing one to do so, it's all up to you. Scaler team will just be there moderating stuff, you will be responsible for sharing content and everything on these groups. 

Also, someone suggested in the above discussion to create a common group?  I don't think we will be able to achieve that on WhatsApp due to its member limit, we can use Telegram, and all the achievers can help run it, let me know whatever works for you.
22/04/20, 8:04 pm - Rishi Bajpai: Yes, a telegram group can be a great option if we are going to create a common group or something like that.
22/04/20, 8:06 pm - +91 86004 69998: I think creating a telegram channel will be better because inspite of creating different whatsapp group of different colleges it's tough to maintain the members of group as some of them are not interested and due to this peoples other people also feel the same,so by creating a telegram channel we can just send a link and mention "Those people who are tech evangelist and are intereted in growing their community via SAC can join".What you all say guys?This is my point of view.
22/04/20, 8:08 pm - +91 70113 12289: One telegram channel for all colleges?
22/04/20, 8:09 pm - +91 78148 84914: +1
22/04/20, 8:09 pm - +91 96604 10794: +1
22/04/20, 8:09 pm - +91 86004 69998: it can work, I am just giving an opinion
22/04/20, 8:10 pm - +91 99033 48739: +1
22/04/20, 8:10 pm - +91 95606 78655: We can have both the options, whoever are comfortable using one common Telegram can have that, and those who all can create WhatsApp groups for their college, it's all up to you.
22/04/20, 8:11 pm - +91 95606 78655: I will create a Telegram Group.
22/04/20, 8:11 pm - +91 78958 48767: But when we need registration  from our unique link then ...
22/04/20, 8:12 pm - Rishi Bajpai: Exactly, this way we can also have accurate information about the total participation, and the members who are really interested
22/04/20, 8:14 pm - +91 86004 69998: Exactly and also this group will contain the members which are really interested in tech building from across the countries and also they can put their opinion their without any hesitation
22/04/20, 8:14 pm - Rishi Bajpai: I think everyone of us have their separate groups in their colleges to promote such activities. Just a fact, plus won't it be difficult for Scalar Academy officials @919740166567 @919560678655 to monitor this huge number of whatsapp groups if each of us are going to create one ?
22/04/20, 8:16 pm - +91 86004 69998: +1 we are 183 members I think in this group
22/04/20, 8:17 pm - Rishi Bajpai: Plus telegram also provides useful tools like surveys, bots like things, that we can use for better interaction and feedbacks
22/04/20, 8:52 pm - +91 97174 36716: Okay,i have suggested that 
Telegram will do the work too.

22/04/20, 9:15 pm - +91 99453 27168: But added today

22/04/20, 9:32 pm - +91 81378 71888: But there is a problem that some people dont have telegram and they are comfortable with whatsapp. How to manage those people? @919560678655
22/04/20, 9:46 pm - +91 95606 78655: You can create WhatsApp groups.
22/04/20, 9:46 pm - +91 95606 78655: Upto you

23/04/20, 1:47 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: hey aditya - yes CodekNIT is only for NIT students at the moment :) Will organise more contests in the coming weeks and months for IIIT and other colleges as well.

30/04/20, 5:15 pm - +91 79028 17288: I don't prefer affiliate links to be useful as many would just remove the code from the link and then use.

In the competitive programming community, people are posting something that is exposing a hideous side about Scaler Academy

Some of them, like "Striver" are 6* coders with offers from Media.net and Amazon,
Are most reputable.

Please look into this at the earliest, and let everyone of us know how you are planning to deal with all this?

I am going to give you guys the benefit of doubt, but please understand that our LinkedIn profiles mention Scaler Academy Achiever, and we would be badly associated if any of it comes out to be true.

Hope you understand and take this utmost seriously.

07/05/20, 7:28 pm - +91 86004 69998: @919740166567 @919560678655 I think you should arrange a webinar or meet for all our achievers regarding all this stuff that is happening around us i.e Scaler Acheivers so that those who have any doubts or questions related issues will get cleared through it.This is just my opinion.
07/05/20, 7:29 pm - +91 86004 69998: And the let abhimanyu or Anshuman sir host the meet or webinar...

07/05/20, 7:57 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: Hello everyone,

I want to clarify on the current situation. Scaler Academy has been under attack for a while by people unknown. They have resorted to stealing, phishing and even harassing students of Scaler Academy (some of the screenshots attached in the below LinkedIn post). Raj was victim of another such harassment and we are working with him to figure out the culprits. He himself has been approached multiple times for payment to post against us for false propaganda which he has refused to.

You can check Raj's post here: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6663888898592251904/

Anshuman has posted on the same thing with screenshots along with Raj. Details at https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6664136150439071744/

This is an attack on all of us. I just want to re-assure you that we will do everything we can to bring an end to this.

After you read the above two posts, if you have any more questions, Anshuman will be hosting a webinar on May 8th at 8pm for all Scaler Achievers to answer all your questions. I’ll share the webinar link shortly.
07/05/20, 7:58 pm - +91 86004 69998: thanks @919740166567
07/05/20, 7:59 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: will also share a link to send us your questions beforehand so that anshuman can respond to them efficiently
07/05/20, 7:59 pm - +91 97174 36716: Good to see response by Team SAC
Thank you

So that everyone can see this
07/05/20, 8:11 pm - +91 95606 78655: One last point I wanted to add to Varun's message: 

You all are Scaler Achievers, a part of the Scaler family! :) We're so sorry to hear that some of you felt uncomfortable about the situation, or when your classmates/friends asked you about it. After reading the posts linked above, if you're convinced about the situation now, please speak to your friends who are confused and may not know the full picture. 

Thanks a lot everyone! We're doing everything we can to find out the culprits, and are glad that you're with us on this journey! :)

08/05/20, 9:24 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: hey everyone - thanks a lot to those of you who joined :) 

We're thinking of conducting QnA sessions like these (with no specific topic in mind; it will be an open-ended chat with you and Anshuman and/or Abhimanyu) every few weeks or so. Will also share a form for you to enter your questions before the session. Do you think this would be something you all would be interested in attending? 

Anshuman is more than happy to do these frequently if you all will attend and get any advice you need :)

One more query I have... 
Is Scaler and Interviewbit different? Bcz at most of the places on web i have seen that, it is written like, "Interviewbit is now Scaler Academy." 

Are we the Campus ambassador for Scaler academy only or for Scaler and Interviewbit both?
11/06/20, 4:25 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: hey guys! this is an interesting suggestion, thanks for letting me know
11/06/20, 4:25 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: will speak to my team tomorrow regarding this

Efficient Header Compression technique for IP based communication over Satellite network:
SATCOM networks operate under bandwidth & power limited scenarios. In order to effectively utilize the network resources, the overheads are required to be reduced (specially TCP/IP Headers) in the user traffic. The IP header compression scheme should accept TCP/IP traffic from users & provide header compressed data over satellite link. The header compression system should support all protocols & provide seamless communication among multiple users by minimizing the TCP/IP headers through elimination/caching static fields.

The compression algorithm should be capable of maximizing Header compression factor for applications like VoIP, FTP, HTTP etc. & handling static/dynamic fields of TCP/IP headers during communication between multiple users.

Desired Outcome: Complete algorithm development for header compression technique, system development and demonstration with different IP based services like – VoIP, FTP etc. Microcontroller based solution will be cheered

DATA: Real Time VoIP calling, FTP between server & client etc.

17/07/20, 12:03 pm - +91 60015 91627: Anyways I do regret spending so much time here and didnt even received a single coffee cup, leave a tshirt.It's better to do some open source contribution or competitive coding atleast they will payoff in long run.@Admins I spoke the truth only.Sorry everyone incase anyone got hurt by my statements but these are what I felt about. I'm leaving this group too.

17/07/20, 12:19 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: Sure - will an official email from me work?
17/07/20, 12:19 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: at least in my college, an email clarifying the position worked for placement teams

17/07/20, 12:22 pm - +91 91679 73912: Yes   this would be enough
17/07/20, 12:22 pm - +91 95606 78655: I would say things like tee-shirts, and any other perks including certificates are just a motivational factor to drive the program, it's you who should be taking initiative, it's not always about taking from the community, it's more of giving back, our program's goal is to make sure that our achievers are able to lead other students in their campuses in the right direction with our support.

A new mission is added to your dashboard regarding our new Scaler Hiring Challenge. Have a look at the earliest and let us know if you have questions!
29/07/20, 4:02 pm - +91 85956 13389: Also please note that if you are messaging me, please write your Full Name, College, email, and TnP email and phone number.
29/07/20, 4:40 pm - +91 78958 48767: Scaler is hiring for open positions (internships and full-time) in our tech/engineering team, through a hiring contest called *The Scaler Hiring Challenge*.
 In this Challenge, we aim to find the best tech talent in the country by judging contestants *only* on skill, passion and experience, thereby bypassing traditional hiring biases towards college name and branch.

29/07/20, 4:41 pm - +91 82299 98446: CTC for intern and full time people are asking

29/07/20, 4:44 pm - +91 82103 37620: And also I think most of the Students are from 2021 class. And the class 2020 has already passed out from our institute. 

So, if you can separately launch a drive for 2021 batch, more participation we can provide you from our college & it will be more beneficial for us.
29/07/20, 4:46 pm - +91 78958 48767: And internship would be in summer 2021?
29/07/20, 4:49 pm - +91 87087 41206: +1
29/07/20, 4:51 pm - +91 74979 88931: +1
29/07/20, 4:51 pm - +91 86004 69998: Is it a part of codersbit 2020?
29/07/20, 4:52 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: hey everyone -- please continue to ask your doubts here. we'll reply to all of them at one go :)
29/07/20, 4:53 pm - +91 87950 47029: Yes. Students are asking for CTC
29/07/20, 4:57 pm - +91 99115 18725: +1
29/07/20, 4:57 pm - +91 99115 18725: they are egerly asking in bulk
29/07/20, 5:02 pm - +91 73525 70838: https://www.scaler.com/contest/scalerhiring?rcy=1&rce=c2db902870de
29/07/20, 5:02 pm - +91 73525 70838: for internship and full-time opportunity
29/07/20, 5:24 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: for now, please tell them that is TBD
29/07/20, 5:24 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: once decided, will update the JD doc :)
29/07/20, 5:56 pm - +91 87087 41206: Any update on the goodies side ?
29/07/20, 5:57 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: yes i'll be emailing you all by friday
29/07/20, 7:23 pm - +91 93067 70190: I believe there is some sort of loophole in the whole process. Every student that registers for the contest gets their own referral links with promising goodies. That kind of defies the purpose of us SACs promoting the contest in our colleges. Also it'll lead to a false leaderboard on the scaler dashboard. please look into it asap @917975603869  @919560678655
29/07/20, 7:26 pm - +91 78148 84914: +1
29/07/20, 7:26 pm - +91 78148 84914: I agree with you.
29/07/20, 7:26 pm - +91 78148 84914: Yes @917975603869
29/07/20, 7:26 pm - +91 78148 84914: Kindly look for that
29/07/20, 7:26 pm - +91 83830 06342: +1
29/07/20, 7:26 pm - +91 88538 31965: It has always been there, the reason many students start promoting the same event before us,and till we start promoting it , it's already spammed by many of them at every place .
29/07/20, 7:26 pm - +91 78148 84914: Yes
29/07/20, 7:27 pm - +91 83830 06342: Yup
29/07/20, 7:28 pm - Rishi Bajpai: +1

29/07/20, 7:30 pm - +91 77618 02234: +1
29/07/20, 7:31 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: hey guys -- the referral system we use for these contests is the only way to reach interested students in colleges where we have no presence, or no Achiever.
29/07/20, 7:32 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: since our priority is to find the best candidates across every college in the country
29/07/20, 7:33 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: since we only have ~300 Achievers like yourselves, but there are 1000s of colleges where there may be fantastic talented students
29/07/20, 7:34 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: will find a solution to the leaderboard issue you raised, however :)
29/07/20, 7:54 pm - +91 93067 70190: A few students have also pointed out another issue.
29/07/20, 7:54 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: yes please tell me
29/07/20, 7:55 pm - +91 78148 84914: Sir @917975603869 there is really issue
29/07/20, 7:55 pm - +91 93067 70190: <Media omitted>
29/07/20, 7:55 pm - +91 78148 84914: It's unfair with others Achievers
29/07/20, 7:56 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: ah yes - there's an issue with the chrome browser on mobile. Can you please ask them to register on a desktop? Should work perfectly :)
29/07/20, 7:56 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: However, this is being worked on now as well
29/07/20, 7:56 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: will expedite with the tech team
29/07/20, 7:57 pm - +91 93067 70190: Yes i have asked them to do the same. Just wanted to bring this to your attention :)
29/07/20, 7:57 pm - +91 93067 70190: Sure, thanks :)
29/07/20, 7:58 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: thanks shekhar! have just expedited with the tech team, fingers crossed that it will be fixed by tomorrow 1
29/07/20, 7:58 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: !*
29/07/20, 8:00 pm - +91 78148 84914: @917975603869 also the students are registering really they are from same college or not
29/07/20, 8:00 pm - +91 78148 84914: Mobile no. are same or not
29/07/20, 8:01 pm - +91 78148 84914: Sir lot of issues are there
29/07/20, 8:01 pm - +91 78148 84914: Data sir
29/07/20, 8:01 pm - +91 78148 84914: I am talking about data
29/07/20, 8:01 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: Ah yes, good feedback, thanks -- will enquire internally for a solution
29/07/20, 8:02 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: please suggest any fixes if you think of them!
29/07/20, 8:02 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: You can DM me or @918595613389
29/07/20, 8:03 pm - +91 78148 84914: Also sir I also got 800 points for this task as I'm top Scaler Achiver but sir for others Scalers I would love to say that those who have got points for this task remove all points
29/07/20, 8:04 pm - +91 78148 84914: And start from 0
29/07/20, 8:04 pm - +91 78148 84914: For all achivers
29/07/20, 8:04 pm - +91 78148 84914: So that no Scaler Achievers can be sad
29/07/20, 8:04 pm - +91 78148 84914: Give sujjestion folks:)?
29/07/20, 8:05 pm - +91 78148 84914: M I right?
29/07/20, 8:05 pm - +91 78148 84914: And what do you say @917975603869 ?
29/07/20, 8:06 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: Hey Bhavesh - can you DM @918595613389 to discuss?
29/07/20, 8:06 pm - +91 78148 84914: Sure sir.

29/07/20, 8:12 pm - +91 78958 48767: Why?
29/07/20, 8:19 pm - +91 74155 04371: No
29/07/20, 8:37 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: Also guys -- since most of you would have registered for the Challenge, if enough of you want, we can organise a SAC-exclusive Q&A session with the tech team to answer any questions you have about the roles, company, tech team etc
29/07/20, 8:37 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: let me know!
29/07/20, 8:38 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: if enough of you are interested, we can organise the session next week
29/07/20, 8:38 pm - +91 86004 69998: it will be good then @917975603869
29/07/20, 8:38 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: i can float a form to find out how many are interested :)
29/07/20, 8:38 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: awesome!
29/07/20, 8:38 pm - +91 93067 70190: That sounds like a great idea!
29/07/20, 9:08 pm - +91 87501 66010: Why so ?
29/07/20, 9:09 pm - +91 87501 66010: Sounds great
29/07/20, 9:12 pm - +91 87680 65252: I have a question are the criteria must to get the position if one clears the Coding Interview @917975603869 ?
29/07/20, 9:13 pm - +91 87680 65252: If 5* in Codechef and Expert in CF is the threshold, maybe many will fail to get it, just curious on it.
29/07/20, 9:15 pm - +91 87501 66010: The same question from my side also.
I was also thinking about it.

29/07/20, 10:34 pm - +91 80555 22987: Any one facing this problem
29/07/20, 10:35 pm - +91 86022 17822: Try opening the link on PC
29/07/20, 10:37 pm - +91 93067 70190: Actually there is. Try clicking on the white space under duration
29/07/20, 10:42 pm - +91 78148 84914: Bcoz no transparency is there
29/07/20, 10:42 pm - +91 78148 84914: @917975603869
29/07/20, 10:42 pm - +91 78148 84914: Anyone can rejister and get 100 points
29/07/20, 10:43 pm - +91 78148 84914: Using fake mails
29/07/20, 10:43 pm - +91 78148 84914: + invalid data
29/07/20, 10:43 pm - +91 78148 84914: Yes, Avirup
29/07/20, 10:44 pm - +91 78148 84914: Don't confirm the registration until and unless
29/07/20, 10:44 pm - +91 70593 78286: but that could create a discrepancy in selecting the top performers at the end of the year.
29/07/20, 10:45 pm - +91 78148 84914: Email address is not going to confirm by the rejister candidate
29/07/20, 10:45 pm - +91 78148 84914: I'm saying from this task
29/07/20, 10:45 pm - +91 78148 84914: Bcoz everyone is getting 100 points
29/07/20, 10:45 pm - +91 78148 84914: Using fake mails
29/07/20, 10:45 pm - +91 78148 84914: + invalid data.
29/07/20, 10:46 pm - +91 87501 66010: We can count only those who have given the test
29/07/20, 10:46 pm - +91 87501 66010: That's it.
Fake ones will not give test
29/07/20, 10:46 pm - +91 78148 84914: But in achivers
29/07/20, 10:46 pm - +91 78148 84914: Dashboard
29/07/20, 10:46 pm - +91 78148 84914: There ranking and points are counting
29/07/20, 10:47 pm - +91 78148 84914: From now
29/07/20, 10:47 pm - +91 70593 78286: or since it is a hiring challenge scaler can verify id cards of students as well. I guess students will not hesitate to provide id when its a hiring process not any other coding contests
29/07/20, 10:47 pm - +91 78148 84914: It should to show after the test
29/07/20, 10:47 pm - +91 78148 84914: Yes in form that should be there
29/07/20, 10:47 pm - +91 78148 84914: Bcoz I can see
29/07/20, 10:48 pm - +91 87501 66010: After the test we can calculate
Total points - number of people didn't gave test*100
29/07/20, 10:49 pm - +91 78148 84914: Change the form
29/07/20, 10:49 pm - +91 78148 84914: Start from 0 points
29/07/20, 10:49 pm - +91 78148 84914: That's the right way
29/07/20, 10:49 pm - +91 87501 66010: Making the count directly zero will make the value of our efforts 0
29/07/20, 10:49 pm - +91 70593 78286: @917975603869 @918595613389 you can consider this
29/07/20, 10:49 pm - +91 78148 84914: Yes Mukul
29/07/20, 10:49 pm - +91 78148 84914: That's why I m saying
29/07/20, 10:49 pm - +91 78148 84914: Brother
29/07/20, 10:50 pm - +91 78148 84914: Or about test
29/07/20, 10:50 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: Thanks for the suggestions!! These are very good ideas
29/07/20, 10:50 pm - +91 78148 84914: It's depend upon the students
29/07/20, 10:50 pm - +91 70593 78286: there could be another issue. suppose someone genuinely registered but couldn't attend the test because of some other reasons
29/07/20, 10:50 pm - +91 78148 84914: They want to give or not
29/07/20, 10:50 pm - +91 78148 84914: May be he or she was unable to give test
29/07/20, 10:50 pm - +91 78148 84914: Vhi avirup
29/07/20, 10:51 pm - +91 78148 84914: Agree
29/07/20, 10:51 pm - +91 70593 78286: or lets say talking about fake registrations if someone saw that his or her performance is not good he can again create a new registration with another email and give the test that would not be fair
29/07/20, 10:51 pm - +91 87501 66010: Very less probability.
And we can surely ignore them since they didn't contributed in the count of contest
29/07/20, 10:51 pm - +91 78148 84914: 2000 points I m wondered
29/07/20, 10:51 pm - +91 70593 78286: this also should not be counted right
29/07/20, 10:51 pm - +91 78148 84914: How's it possible
29/07/20, 10:51 pm - +91 87501 66010: Contest is of 3 hours.
This is not a codechef long challenge
29/07/20, 10:52 pm - +91 78148 84914: Within a 4 hours
29/07/20, 10:52 pm - +91 78148 84914: Means 100 registration
29/07/20, 10:52 pm - +91 70593 78286: yes but there's a possibility someone can register from more than one emails cause there is no email verification in scaler.com you can login and register for the contest with any random email
29/07/20, 10:52 pm - +91 78148 84914: 😦😦🙏
29/07/20, 10:53 pm - +91 78148 84914: That's what
29/07/20, 10:53 pm - +91 78148 84914: I said
29/07/20, 10:53 pm - +91 78148 84914: And Change in the form
29/07/20, 10:53 pm - +91 78148 84914: With proper
29/07/20, 10:53 pm - +91 78148 84914: I'd card
29/07/20, 10:53 pm - +91 78148 84914: Emergency can be happen
29/07/20, 10:53 pm - +91 78148 84914: Depend upon mood
29/07/20, 10:53 pm - +91 78148 84914: Lot of things
29/07/20, 10:53 pm - +91 78148 84914: Internet
29/07/20, 10:54 pm - +91 78148 84914: In villages there is no light
29/07/20, 10:54 pm - +91 78148 84914: Proper internet
29/07/20, 10:54 pm - +91 78148 84914: Everyone is not rich
29/07/20, 10:54 pm - +91 78148 84914: And not in the vity6
29/07/20, 10:54 pm - +91 78148 84914: City
29/07/20, 10:54 pm - +91 87501 66010: 🙏
29/07/20, 10:54 pm - +91 78148 84914: It's all india
29/07/20, 10:55 pm - +91 78148 84914: *_@917975603869 sir do change, start from 0 + confirm mail by rejister candidate + I'd card in the form._*
29/07/20, 10:56 pm - +91 78148 84914: Otherwise it's unfair with hardworkers Scaler Achievers.
29/07/20, 10:57 pm - +91 78148 84914: Any can do 100000 registration and can become top performer
29/07/20, 10:59 pm - +91 81696 57276: Around 40 students from my college has already registered 
No one would take the pains to re register
29/07/20, 11:00 pm - +91 81696 57276: As i sent the link to the tpo

29/07/20, 11:27 pm - +91 93067 70190: I see you're talking about me. 
That is a very stupid alligation to make. I did contact my college's placement officer regarding this, since the very beginning hence people registered from my link. And i can verify every email id registered hence. I am answerable to @917975603869 if he wishes verifications of any such sort. 

Get your facts right before pointing fingers.

30/07/20, 1:20 pm - +91 99033 48739: Any off campus amazon exam ? Anyone ? Any info?
30/07/20, 1:21 pm - +91 96537 00880: Really difficult this time for freshers. Since they gave like a lot of PPOs this year
30/07/20, 1:23 pm - +91 99033 48739: Any other companies ?

30/07/20, 1:27 pm - +91 70108 24101: I have a doubt, is the Amazon University Recruitment comes only under campus placement or even online application?
30/07/20, 1:44 pm - +91 96537 00880: Only under campus placements
30/07/20, 1:44 pm - +91 96537 00880: They have tie ups with college that how many students they will take and how many they will convert
30/07/20, 1:45 pm - +91 70108 24101: Then what's the point of applying online when they hire only from campus? They don't even visit our college..
30/07/20, 1:46 pm - +91 96537 00880: They don't hire ONLY from college. I am only talking about University hiring. Not the actual hiring.
30/07/20, 1:46 pm - +91 96537 00880: They even have a separate branch called "University Relations" for this
30/07/20, 1:48 pm - +91 70108 24101: I have been applying for past 2 years, never got even a single response, whatever I seen in LinkedIn is students getting selected through University Recruitment..
And Amazon has a policy that they will hire through Internship before graduation
30/07/20, 1:49 pm - +91 99033 48739: Welcome to India ............. I have been facing the same thing too.....
30/07/20, 1:50 pm - +91 99033 48739: I have heard that they conduct a off campus drive where they take an exam then all the process goes through like AMAZEWOW
30/07/20, 1:51 pm - +91 96537 00880: Yup they started Amazon WOW this year cuz people started complaining but that was only for women😂
30/07/20, 1:56 pm - +91 96604 10794: I also not got any mail even after taking  referral  my application  is still under consideration
30/07/20, 1:56 pm - +91 85956 13389: Are these companies coming for internships or placement?
30/07/20, 1:56 pm - +91 96604 10794: Only for women  i think?
30/07/20, 1:56 pm - +91 70108 24101: At which semester did you apply?
30/07/20, 1:56 pm - +91 96537 00880: They come for placements only in the form of PPO what they give after the internship
30/07/20, 1:57 pm - +91 96604 10794: 6th for internship
30/07/20, 1:57 pm - +91 96537 00880: And in some colleges directly job
30/07/20, 1:59 pm - +91 70113 12289: Amazon visited our college in January this year for placement.
30/07/20, 2:00 pm - +91 70113 12289: According to a Quora answer, they visit only those colleges whose owner buys Amazon stocks.
30/07/20, 2:01 pm - +91 76962 98890: 😂😂😂
30/07/20, 2:01 pm - +91 95989 78416: You should try to apply via referral . 
Referral has a high chance of getting response

30/07/20, 2:20 pm - +91 70108 24101: Btw have anyone got referral by reaching out to someone in linkedin?
30/07/20, 2:29 pm - +91 6376 486 690: @917975603869  The button visibility issue in Mobile device  is still there. You said u will be solved.
30/07/20, 2:29 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: still being worked on Sunil
30/07/20, 2:31 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: until then, please ask them to register on desktop
30/07/20, 2:31 pm - +91 96604 10794: Yup by alumni  
I hv got any kind of help by alumni  only rest are only so called  connections
30/07/20, 2:31 pm - +91 6376 486 690: Okay🙌🏻
30/07/20, 2:35 pm - +91 70108 24101: Oof, seriously this is just making me think that none of my experience, skills and projects will be helping me atleast get into the interview process... Afterall only referral and competitive programming profile is what deciding everything 🤦🏻‍♂️
30/07/20, 2:36 pm - +91 76962 98890: Bhai ese mt soch
30/07/20, 2:36 pm - +91 96604 10794: Yup I hv realise  this very late but now I still doing  projects  because  of Internship  can't  able  to manage  time to do cp
30/07/20, 2:38 pm - +91 96604 10794: Like how can company  identify  that weather  you built any project  by your own or just took from github and modify it by some  extent 
They  also hv forcedness to give more prority to cp
30/07/20, 2:39 pm - +91 83830 06342: +1
30/07/20, 2:41 pm - +91 70108 24101: Well I don't think this is the reason..
30/07/20, 2:42 pm - +91 96604 10794: You can get several  blogs on Google  where many hv explained  why top company  give more prority to cp
30/07/20, 2:43 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: hey everyone -- the tentative joining dates and stipend/CTC details has been added to the JD doc for the Hiring Challenge
30/07/20, 2:43 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: have*
30/07/20, 2:43 pm - +91 70108 24101: Well Competitive Programming skills are been asked to test the ability of a person how they can code, because they have good ability to think quickly, write a well structured code.. but the same characteristics will be applied for product developers too.. I'm an open source contributor and I am contributing to big organisations, and it needs a good quality code since it will be used in the production.. and yea it is really not necessary to be a competitive programmer to show these skills
30/07/20, 2:47 pm - +91 96604 10794: If any one have good cp profile  then of course  that person  have good Iq and and hardworker but the main things  is you can't judge any ony by this currently  I am doing  projects  I hv completely  understand  research  paper behind this and my concept are clear  but still I am facing  issue to improve  accuracy  of my project  that's  come by experience  not by doing  cp
30/07/20, 2:48 pm - +91 70108 24101: Exactly I agree with that, but at the end who is making the decision?
30/07/20, 2:49 pm - +91 96604 10794: I am not hr so leave  this here and do cp because  it's  only easy way to succeed 😅😅
30/07/20, 2:50 pm - +91 70108 24101: 😓
30/07/20, 2:50 pm - +91 70108 24101: Seems like have to take 100 days challenge
30/07/20, 2:51 pm - +91 96604 10794: 100 days challenge?
30/07/20, 2:52 pm - +91 96604 10794: *IF ANY ONE HV DONE ANY WORK ON Conv LSTM or GAN THEN PLEASE DM* 🙏🏻
30/07/20, 2:53 pm - +91 70108 24101: 100 day of code, it's a challenge that you make to yourself to learn or improve Programming skills with in 100 days by coding at least 2 hours a day
30/07/20, 2:55 pm - +91 77008 73795: I have done some works on convolutional neural networks and and have some knowledge about LSTM...
30/07/20, 2:55 pm - +91 96604 10794: I don't  this so just 2 hour is enoug I hv done cp for 4 month per day 8-9 hour still I m expert at codeforce and aroud 1800 at codechef

31/07/20, 8:42 pm - +91 86004 69998: @917975603869 While sending the mails to our tnp's please keep all SAC's in cc----->Suggestion
31/07/20, 8:42 pm - +91 86004 69998: so that we will get to know
31/07/20, 8:42 pm - +91 81783 40031: I guess it will be sent separately, with our referral links
31/07/20, 8:43 pm - +91 86004 69998: I mean that college tnp with that college's SAC
31/07/20, 8:44 pm - +91 86004 69998: Suppose I belong to x college then while sending the mail to my college's tnp officer he will keep me in cc......
31/07/20, 8:45 pm - +91 81783 40031: Okay
31/07/20, 8:45 pm - +91 86004 69998: Likewise each college's tnp with its college's SAC
31/07/20, 8:46 pm - +91 79028 17288: That's a good suggestion.
31/07/20, 8:52 pm - +91 96537 00880: Great idea
31/07/20, 8:53 pm - +91 78747 13219: Exactly! This is a great idea!

01/08/20, 3:10 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: hey everyone -- unfortunately, the emailing portal we use to send emails only allows one single cc email ID in one email batch :(
01/08/20, 3:10 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: for example, if i email 10 recipients, i only have the option of using one email address for all in cc
01/08/20, 3:11 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: if you're ok with waiting till Monday, i can check with the tech team if we can find a workaround for this
01/08/20, 3:11 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: since they're all on leave today..
01/08/20, 3:12 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: if you prefer sending today itself, i can send now and let you know the subject line and exact time sent, so that you can follow up with the TnP official
01/08/20, 3:13 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: what do you think @918600469998 @917902817288 @919653700880 @918178340031 ?

03/08/20, 9:48 pm - +91 91065 84241: When is the leaderboard going to be updated on the basis of strength of college?

A college having more than 3000+ intakes for CSE cannot be competed with a college hardly having 300 refferals.
03/08/20, 9:49 pm - +91 87501 66010: I raised this issue during the first quarter.
This is also *[Important]*
03/08/20, 9:50 pm - +91 91065 84241: I too. It's been more than 2-3 months now. We must see the conversion rate and not the referrals only.
03/08/20, 9:54 pm - +91 86004 69998: Let it be guys its just for keeping track of our progress, if your college strength is 2000 and if you are able to get register 2000 students but still not on top thats no problem, you must be proud that you have convinced all students...to participate
03/08/20, 9:56 pm - +91 86004 69998: In fact my clg strength is around 4000 including all the campuses in our clg but still I m not on top,thats the regret I m feeling but still working hard for it....
03/08/20, 9:58 pm - +91 91065 84241: Who said many of us we have 2000 ?
Many don't have even 200.
03/08/20, 9:58 pm - +91 81783 40031: My college strength is just 65 students in CSE in a year
03/08/20, 9:58 pm - +91 91065 84241: +1. Mine is nearby only.
03/08/20, 9:58 pm - +91 91065 84241: If it's about the *"Leaderboard"*, then we surely have to be fair to everyone.
03/08/20, 9:58 pm - +91 86004 69998: .....
03/08/20, 10:00 pm - +91 91065 84241: You can't name it a *"Leaderboard"*, bcoz the person on top has surely not given the maximum efforts in comparison to all.
03/08/20, 10:00 pm - +91 86004 69998: but what you can achieve being on the top...
03/08/20, 10:01 pm - +91 79028 17288: Did you know that Scaler said about an incentive to the top performers every quarter?
03/08/20, 10:01 pm - +91 91065 84241: Then what is the use of Leaderboard. Let's just help the community without such stuffs.
03/08/20, 10:01 pm - +91 86004 69998: then lets just ignore it
03/08/20, 10:01 pm - +91 86004 69998: Ya I got it
03/08/20, 10:02 pm - +91 79028 17288: So I guess there should be some kinda fairness required 😌
03/08/20, 10:02 pm - +91 91065 84241: Brother, we put our time and effort for those were we get something back. Can't just waste it
03/08/20, 10:02 pm - +91 91065 84241: where*
03/08/20, 10:04 pm - +91 79028 17288: Simply forward messages to a group having a strength of 1000+ and getting referals vs actually going behind people and convincing them to join are two different scenarios. 
I understand you.
03/08/20, 10:05 pm - +91 91065 84241: Exactly. That's what I am trying to understand all.
03/08/20, 10:06 pm - +91 91065 84241: make understand*

10/08/20, 1:00 pm - +91 81378 71888: I dont think the govt is dumb to open colleges just hoping this would be over by September

10/08/20, 1:01 pm - +91 81378 71888: Same here but in 3 days for me

10/08/20, 3:57 pm - +91 86004 69998: Hey guys I have applied for microsoft learn student ambassador, and in the application form I have provided my certificates google drive link and acclaim profile in additional information section,so Is it a good idea or should I remove the links?
10/08/20, 6:38 pm - +91 78747 13219: No, it works! No issues! I applied in 2019, Even i did the same, but some people also thot that rather than google drive, they used Microsoft one drive because they were applying for Microsoft :)
10/08/20, 6:50 pm - +91 91065 84241: Point to be noted 😄😂
10/08/20, 7:06 pm - +91 86004 69998: Thanks for your suggestion
10/08/20, 7:17 pm - +91 86004 69998: Youtube is also a product of google but most of the msp's share the youtube video's link......
10/08/20, 7:21 pm - +91 81793 92653: @917874713219 , some do that , but it doesn't matter which platform you prefer , all it matters is the way you talk infront of the camera, they check your communication skills , and how confident are you when you are  talking to the camera.
10/08/20, 7:33 pm - +91 78747 13219: Absolutely you are correct! Our confidence matters after all ! 🙂
10/08/20, 8:34 pm - +91 86004 69998: https://youtu.be/iLJC0fi32wI
10/08/20, 8:35 pm - +91 86004 69998: Guys want your honest reviews on this..
10/08/20, 9:01 pm - +91 81793 92653: Hey @918600469998 , here you go:


1) First things first it lacks confidence, you should have read the script and made at least 3-4 takes for the video.
2)Should not mention etc in your video
3)Script is Good in the starting but you lack that energy.
4)Script is very lengthy which started from education sector and directly went to medical sector, you should have explained it in a proper way.(even if its lengthy you should speak in such a way that person on the other side should feel something interesting in your video coz Program Managers from diff locations may review it. 
5)Don't worry much about MSA, it is just a platform to learn and explore, it will not weigh that much in your resume except 10-15% in any interview, all that matters is your knowledge on Basics i.e Data Structures and your Competitive coding , these are all "good to have" but our basics and subject knowledge is "must to have".
6)Don't think much about it , try once again you will get selected.
10/08/20, 9:02 pm - +91 81793 92653: Anyways this is nice work but if you include all the things I mentioned It would be awesome.
10/08/20, 9:02 pm - +91 81793 92653: thanks
10/08/20, 9:03 pm - +91 86004 69998: thanks for your suggestions and complement , I will definitely work on it..

10/08/20, 9:54 pm - +91 91065 84241: Ohh, really?
Then why are you here in this group too then?
If you don't seem it as an achievement, then it's your problem.
But you shouldn't say this in a group of more than 200 memebrs who are active in Community building.
10/08/20, 9:58 pm - +91 70108 24101: I see it as a responsibility to be honest, 
it's not just about adding a title in our profile, it's all about what we do to improve the community and grow it better..
And that's what we have said before becoming a campus lead..
10/08/20, 10:01 pm - +91 91065 84241: Yeah, agree. But it motivates you if you take even little things as achievement.😃😀

Does it make any sense doing +1 or -1 for this purpose?
18/08/20, 8:53 pm - +91 88538 31965: It's just a matter of swags,within day or two you all will recieve,there isn't a point of checking out on everyone and sharing location time to time,it isn't in control of anyone from the group. I guess that's understandable to everyone !

19/08/20, 12:29 pm - +91 86028 42290: Hey, can someone tell me how to upload a file or a csv file to mongodb, i am using flask as a framework.
19/08/20, 12:32 pm - +91 93401 10522: flask m to i am not very sure but you can run python function in backend and  can store your data is csv file by providing path
19/08/20, 12:33 pm - +91 86028 42290: Should i have to convert that into dict or json before exporting?
19/08/20, 12:34 pm - +91 82260 64719: Yes, ingest it rowwise. I am assuming you are using PyMongo?
19/08/20, 12:35 pm - +91 86028 42290: Yess
19/08/20, 12:36 pm - +91 82260 64719: If the data is in large batches I wouldn't recommend ingesting it in batch, but iterate over the batch and push it one row at a time as a document.
19/08/20, 12:36 pm - +91 82260 64719: Because there have been some known issues while ingesting large batches of files in a singke go.

20/08/20, 2:24 pm - +91 91065 84241: There must be option of relative path and absolute path when you right click just like for photos
20/08/20, 2:28 pm - +91 86028 42290: but I want to do it dynamically, suppose you want to upload a CSV file, you have chosen the file and then your backend should check it by read_csv it's CSV or not, for this, it needs a full path of that CSV file.
20/08/20, 2:31 pm - +91 91065 84241: okay, google it bro.

Thanks for the lovely Welcome 😄
25/08/20, 12:39 pm - +91 97174 36716: Welcome @919001553375 🤩
25/08/20, 12:39 pm - +91 90015 53375: Hope you all are keeping safe. We have planned a fun new task for you. Since there are a lot of important events coming up in the remaining months of the year, we want to open up for creative ideas and campaigns from you guys.
There are only 2 rules  :
Rule 1 : They need to be highly engaging on our social platforms.
Rule 2:  Follow Rule 1. 

What’s in their for you!
The first person to share an idea that is implemented by us from our social media will get an honarary mention with due credit to you!
The First Event is Teacher’s day (5th September).
So get creative. Let your ideas flow.
25/08/20, 12:43 pm - +91 90015 53375: 🚨 One important brand guideline to note : You can be witty and funny but its a Clear-No for Meme content !
25/08/20, 12:45 pm - +91 90015 53375: Looking forward to some engaging ideas from the SAC community. Bring it On! 😊⏳
25/08/20, 12:47 pm - +91 86004 69998: do we have to suggest some events or something else?
25/08/20, 12:52 pm - +91 90015 53375: Yup. You can suggest campaign ideas or events for social platforms.
25/08/20, 12:56 pm - +91 86004 69998: If you are asking for an event, here is a suggestion:

As we all know that recently our education system has been modified with bringing "programming" for students right from 6th standard.
So,It's a suggestion to scaler academy to conduct a 2-3 days event for students from 6th to 12th standard as well as for the teachers
regarding "How to teach coding?" and "How to engage ourself in coding?".Because coding is very new to our young generations so it will
be better for scaler academy to take this initiative and bring the revolutionary change to the education sector.

The event can be conducted as a part of our scaler edge campaign.
This is my point of view--->Need your opinion on this..
25/08/20, 1:05 pm - +91 90015 53375: That's definitely a good idea for penetration. 
However, Aniket this is specific for Social platforms (Scaler IG/LI) for now.
Maybe you could suggest a small campaign around Teachers for college group who is more active on these platforms
25/08/20, 1:06 pm - +91 86004 69998: ok got it.
25/08/20, 4:07 pm - Rishi Bajpai: I think we should try organising some kind of Quiz or Trivia type games using Facebook poll based on Computer Fundamentals and History of Internet like foundational topics at start to gather attention and motivate them to participate. 
The more they participate, the harder the game would be on later posts.
In this scenario this will prompt them to know about the things the don't know and push them to learn more about the topics from Scaler.

Posting these kind of QnA would be informative as well as engaging for general purpose too as it takes only a few secs to mark an option and people like giving their opinion about topics. So this can get maximum shares, likes and increase engagement on Social Media plus putting some reward would be more exciting if possible.

Just an idea... Need other folks suggestions on it to improve this, if it's worth doing.
25/08/20, 4:07 pm - Rishi Bajpai: @919001553375 please have a look
25/08/20, 4:10 pm - +91 99931 65137: Hlo everyone!🥳                 jCloud Day is a single day, virtual, developer-focussed, community driven conference on Java and Cloud.

25/08/20, 4:44 pm - +91 90015 53375: This will work well for IG highlights . what's say. Please help me know how can this be used for Teacher's day in particular.
25/08/20, 4:46 pm - Rishi Bajpai: Yes, it'll be right 
I want to know basically to whom we are targeting ?
25/08/20, 4:50 pm - +91 90015 53375: We are targeting aspiring or existing developers (college students/experienced) that are more active on platforms like Instagram or youtube.
25/08/20, 4:54 pm - +91 83830 06342: Scaler can make more videos on DS Algo and put it on YouTube it will be great

25/08/20, 5:00 pm - +91 90015 53375: I guess there is some confusion here. 

1. Guys the task is  to share some campaign ideas for our social platforms esp. Instagram/LI related to special occasions like Teacher's day, engineers day  etc. 

2. For this time, we want some creative and engaging ideas specifically for Teacher's day. 

3.If the campaign performs great, you would get an honorary mention and due credit for it from our social pages.
25/08/20, 5:01 pm - +91 90015 53375: Let me know if there are any doubts.
25/08/20, 5:05 pm - +91 76962 98890: Respected @919001553375 Mam, I have an idea, we can come up with a hashtag or something like that and write testimonials about people not necessarily teachers but people who have taught us something. This way we include a larger audience and once there is enough momentum other people will follow suit.
Just my humble suggestion 🙏
25/08/20, 5:24 pm - +91 90015 53375: This message was deleted
25/08/20, 5:27 pm - +91 90015 53375: That's a good input. 
do you want to elaborate more around exact execution like- how can we ask students to write these testimonials, 1-2 hashtag ideas, how can it be possibly scaled.
25/08/20, 5:27 pm - +91 96537 00880: This message was deleted
25/08/20, 5:28 pm - +91 96537 00880: Hello Maam, I have an idea. How about a Teacher-Student Duo coding competition? They would have never coded with there teachers and it will be a great opportunity for them to bond and be in the leader board. Will this work?

This will work on insta with an highlight as well where every college can be tagged in a story with the shared screen live coding round. 

Execution will be following parts of SIH where again the students had a colllege professor as a mentor. But this time we can also have a compitition among the college's as well for the leader board which will be shown live.

One thing we will need to focus on is the rounds. For example there wil be serious 50 MCQ rounds followed by fun  rounds and then followed by programming rounds. 

An entire discussion with a panel or organizers of this will clear the small doubts as well and we can really pull this first of its kind compitition.
25/08/20, 5:34 pm - +91 76962 98890: For scaling : We should first create enough momentum for this to make it viral. For that, I was thinking that scaler ambassador and scaler students can write a few lines so as to get the ball rolling.( I don't know if more people will write, just an idea). I was thinking of something like nominating people but that won't work I think.

Hashtag ideas - We need a hashtag that increases our brand visibility so something like
#MyScalerHero
25/08/20, 5:48 pm - +91 89758 23894: I have an idea as we know many of the students are studying virtual platforms like youtube. So we can do a online photoshoot campaign where u have to take a photo with any online tutor that you think helped you much in ur life .
You have to share any memorable experience with that by tagging @Scalar acadamy 
Hashtag can be #MyOnlineHero
25/08/20, 5:57 pm - +91 95557 49859: That's a good idea
25/08/20, 5:57 pm - +91 85956 13389: Hey all
Please don't such messages in this group
Keep this group only upto InterviewBit and Scaler discussions.
25/08/20, 5:58 pm - +91 95557 49859: We have already launced an iniciative regarding that in which live classes for ds algo are being conducted
25/08/20, 5:59 pm - Rishi Bajpai: Thanks 😊
I'm thinking more in it to work
25/08/20, 6:05 pm - +91 83830 06342: Yes it very good program .
25/08/20, 6:06 pm - +91 83830 06342: *is
25/08/20, 6:06 pm - +91 86981 87429: How about we keep a contest on insta fb etc that you have to post a short video where you teach someone(maybe your siblings, juniors etc) a small topic or anything useful and the top videos will be rewarded. While posting they can tag scaler academy
25/08/20, 6:38 pm - +91 88514 08462: Sounds good
25/08/20, 6:42 pm - +91 90015 53375: We have got some really good ideas team. Kudos to you guys. 
Keep sharing in more ideas and we can finalise one through a poll.
26/08/20, 10:44 am - Rishi Bajpai: I think we should try organising some kind of Quiz or Trivia type games using Facebook poll based on Computer Fundamentals and History of Internet like foundational topics at start to gather attention and motivate them to participate. 
The more they participate, the harder the game would be on later posts.
In this scenario this will prompt them to know about the things the don't know and push them to learn more about the topics from Scaler.

Posting these kind of QnA would be informative as well as engaging for general purpose too as it takes only a few secs to mark an option and people like giving their opinion about topics. So this can get maximum shares, likes and increase engagement on Social Media plus putting some reward would be more exciting if possible.

Just an idea... Need other folks suggestions on it to improve this, if it's worth doing.

********
So, moving ahead in this idea ********
As we are organizing this event specifically for Teacher's day to increase teacher Student interaction and engagement during this WFH condition.
So, on teachers'day we can create some Quiz or polls type posts on Instagram and Facebook for the community active on our social pages.

1. Teacher Round
Primarily there can be a poll or One liner QnA type 5 easy level questions to maximize the participation from teachers (preferably in Morning between 9 - 12 AM)

2. Student Round
Then intrested teachers can share the post / nominate their students (any 5 students **5th September**) for further round (Students Round) in which students will participate as well as teachers can also help them.
(preferably can be organised on the same social media platform as well between 4-5 PM in evening)

3. Final Round 
The final round will only take participation from the students who answered 70% or above (or whatever criteria you decide) in the students round.

We can conduct this on our scaler platform creating a separate page for this particular purpose. It can comprise  MCQs related to programming or we can perform some test cases if it suits the event. The students performing best in this round will be the winners and be eligible for whatever prizes and Scaler can offer them.

What it has for teachers ?
So, the idea behind taking participation from students also is the students winning the Quiz/Contest will be giving their teachers a surprise and honour by winning it and the prize should be given to the teachers as this is an event focused on teachers' day.

Extract: Teachers will participate -> teachers will nominate students -> Students participate and wins -> Thier mentoring teachers get honoured and get prizes -> Students can get some sort of Scholarship Offer from Scaler on taking any course or something similar to motivate them to perform better in tech.

I think it suits the platform, participating audience, and event. So if it's worth, please give any suggestions guys. 🙌🏻

As Scaler is already doing mock interview sessions, it can also start video sessions of students sharing their Interview experiences. This would be helpful to many students and also make scaler academy more famous as students always try to find in depth Interview experiences. For the interview experiences we already have a large pool of people including Scaler achievers, Scaler TA's, mentors and past students.
Maybe we can start a series on how to crack X company.
This is my humble suggestion, please let me know what you think.
Thanks a lot.

25/09/20, 11:11 am - +91 89758 23894: *and then divide it
25/09/20, 11:13 am - +91 81041 50837: Prog language? 

In python you can split the data from  ,   
And as you know first and last element will contain braces so you can update both positions. 

In c++ you can do this by using sstream library. It does same as I mentioned. Search about it. 

There can be few more ways.

25/09/20, 8:03 pm - +91 96598 72073: depends on the company, mostly if 7lpa +, 1 from array/string/ll another will be from the same in the hard way or tree/graphs

25/09/20, 8:06 pm - Rohit Pal SAC: Okay... I m seeing some pattern like most of the service based cmpy is even asking for the same question like debugging the code.. like in the above Amazon test ..
Means the ratio of difficult is same...
25/09/20, 8:06 pm - +91 81041 50837: They will declare it by 3 weeks after the interview.
25/09/20, 8:07 pm - +91 96598 72073: debugging is specifically in amazon, even that's like cake walk
25/09/20, 8:08 pm - +91 81793 30806: Still not completed interviews are going on
25/09/20, 8:08 pm - +91 75005 73903: Okay thanks

25/09/20, 8:09 pm - Rohit Pal SAC: Ya preety easy question i was shocked... The level of questions.... Even after first round all the student is going to select and they will probably segregate the students based on the cpga..
25/09/20, 8:10 pm - Rohit Pal SAC: Do Amazon asked the debugging question in first round.. or is this the first time... I am expected like they will asked coding question in first round...
25/09/20, 8:11 pm - +91 94084 73852: Again cgpa🤦‍♂️
25/09/20, 8:11 pm - +91 87680 65252: it always asks

25/09/20, 8:12 pm - Rohit Pal SAC: Any idea like how much question of mcq type or of someone apply offcampus the pattern and quality of question is same or vary...
25/09/20, 8:13 pm - +91 87680 65252: bro everything depends company to company

25/09/20, 8:31 pm - +91 83029 38048: ✌🏻
25/09/20, 8:38 pm - +91 98678 60524: Does anyone have a Google FTE interview scheduled sometime soon?
25/09/20, 8:47 pm - +91 83848 69248: I had today.
25/09/20, 8:49 pm - +91 88272 47707: Telephonic interview right?
25/09/20, 8:49 pm - +91 86881 63335: Yess
25/09/20, 8:49 pm - +91 83848 69248: Yes, Google Meet.
25/09/20, 8:49 pm - +91 94084 73852: Plz share experience
25/09/20, 8:50 pm - +91 88272 47707: Can you share your experience.
25/09/20, 8:52 pm - +91 98998 53877: Bhai, apna resume share karna..
Merko toh test ke liye hi shortlist nahi kia..
25/09/20, 8:52 pm - +91 98678 60524: Oh cool. My telephonic round is scheduled for next Wednesday and would love to hear your experience
25/09/20, 8:52 pm - +91 86004 69998: anyone has some idea regarding missing number in array problem?
25/09/20, 8:53 pm - +91 81378 71888: Bro, can you share it as a question?
25/09/20, 8:53 pm - +91 86004 69998: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/missing-number-in-array/0/?category[]=Arrays&difficulty[]=-1&page=1&sortBy=submissions&query=category[]Arraysdifficulty[]-1page1sortBysubmissions
25/09/20, 8:55 pm - +91 81378 71888: Worst case it would be O(n)
25/09/20, 8:56 pm - +91 96598 72073: if array is sorted, do binary search
25/09/20, 8:56 pm - +91 96598 72073: log n
25/09/20, 8:57 pm - +91 83848 69248: I got interview call directly, may be because of my kickstart ranks.
25/09/20, 8:57 pm - +91 98998 53877: Okk..
25/09/20, 8:58 pm - +91 81041 50837: What was ur rank?
25/09/20, 8:58 pm - +91 98998 53877: Baaki jinka bhi interview sceduled hai please ek baar resume dikha do..🙏
25/09/20, 8:58 pm - +91 83848 69248: 203,250
25/09/20, 8:58 pm - +91 81378 71888: That was what I was thinking about
25/09/20, 8:58 pm - +91 83848 69248: It went well. 1 question was asked.
25/09/20, 8:59 pm - +91 83848 69248: Will share the link.
25/09/20, 8:59 pm - +91 81378 71888: But how ?
25/09/20, 8:59 pm - +91 81378 71888: Lets not spam the group. Can you come in private?
25/09/20, 8:59 pm - +91 94084 73852: Check by index
25/09/20, 9:00 pm - +91 96598 72073: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-missing-number-in-a-sorted-array/
25/09/20, 9:02 pm - +91 81041 50837: Rounds?
25/09/20, 9:10 pm - +91 81041 50837: Let's say ur elements are
5 4 2 3
Consider their index from 1 to n. Here 1 to 4.
Now iterate the array. As the elements come, consider that element as index. If that index exists, invert the value at that index. Like if it is 4 make it -4. In this way iterate the whole array. 

After that start the iteration again, index of first positive element will be the missing number. 

Time Complexity O(n) 
Space O(n) if you do manipulation in copy array otherwise it will be O(1)
25/09/20, 9:12 pm - +91 90396 34286: Or simple just use the logic of first n natural numbers
25/09/20, 9:12 pm - +91 90396 34286: As in required number = n(n-1)/2 - array sum
25/09/20, 9:13 pm - +91 81041 50837: Yeah that would be also a great approach
25/09/20, 9:14 pm - +91 86004 69998: Ok thank you guys
25/09/20, 9:14 pm - +91 81378 71888: Will the difference of (sum of n numbers and sum of n-1 numbers) give the answer?
25/09/20, 9:15 pm - +91 81378 71888: Complexity O(1)
25/09/20, 9:15 pm - +91 81378 71888: Right?
25/09/20, 9:15 pm - +91 86004 69998: O(n) I think
25/09/20, 9:15 pm - +91 83848 69248: Last year
25/09/20, 9:16 pm - +91 87087 41206: But u don't know what these (n-1) numbers are ..
For that u have to go through the array once
25/09/20, 9:16 pm - +91 87508 61080: Overflow if n is large
25/09/20, 9:16 pm - +91 83848 69248: So question was,You have Infinite number of integers, for each integer we have to determine whether k consecutive elements are already present in stream or not.
25/09/20, 9:17 pm - +91 81378 71888: Use sum function??
25/09/20, 9:17 pm - +91 87087 41206: Sum function dont have o(1) complexity 😅😅
25/09/20, 9:18 pm - +91 90396 34286: In that case , ans will be sum over  a[i] -(i+1)
25/09/20, 9:18 pm - +91 81378 71888: Yeah right
25/09/20, 9:18 pm - +91 81378 71888: 😅😅
25/09/20, 9:23 pm - +91 81378 71888: This solves it in log n
25/09/20, 9:24 pm - +91 81378 71888: Using binary sear h
25/09/20, 9:24 pm - +91 81378 71888: Search*
25/09/20, 9:27 pm - +91 76962 98890: Wow, great question!
What was your approach?
25/09/20, 9:28 pm - +91 91065 84241: Can anyone solve this question?
25/09/20, 9:28 pm - +91 91065 84241: <Media omitted>
25/09/20, 9:28 pm - +91 97596 44218: maybe sliding window of size k can help
25/09/20, 9:29 pm - +91 76962 98890: But how will you know which window to look?
25/09/20, 9:29 pm - +91 76962 98890: And if we are looking at each window, every time, wouldn't it be too expensive?
25/09/20, 9:30 pm - +91 81696 57276: Specific range for input?
25/09/20, 9:30 pm - +91 97596 44218: window size will be given as k in the question since we have to check k consecutive numbers
25/09/20, 9:31 pm - +91 97596 44218: we actually dont need to check whole window everytime. After first window, its just a matter of checking on integer
25/09/20, 9:31 pm - +91 76962 98890: Yeah I got that
25/09/20, 9:31 pm - +91 76962 98890: How?
25/09/20, 9:33 pm - +91 97596 44218: The reason is if we have a consecutive stream in first window, we simply need to check whether next integer is in stream or not.
And say if numbers in first window is not in stream, the we need to check the whole window.
25/09/20, 9:33 pm - +91 83848 69248: Nope
25/09/20, 9:33 pm - +91 97596 44218: why?
25/09/20, 9:33 pm - +91 97596 44218: what is the time complexity expected?
25/09/20, 9:35 pm - +91 83848 69248: Well I used binary search.
25/09/20, 9:35 pm - +91 83848 69248: May be you are not getting the question right.
25/09/20, 9:36 pm - +91 97596 44218: maybe
25/09/20, 9:36 pm - +91 97596 44218: can u explain in a bit more detailed manner?
25/09/20, 9:37 pm - +91 81696 57276: Is it like you have 5
K=3
You need to check 5 6 7 8
Or any stream having 5
25/09/20, 9:38 pm - +91 83848 69248: This message was deleted
25/09/20, 9:38 pm - +91 83848 69248: For 5, we should check for both 6 7 8 or 2 3 4.
25/09/20, 9:46 pm - +91 81696 57276: 3456?
25/09/20, 9:47 pm - +91 83848 69248: Yes.
25/09/20, 9:47 pm - +91 81696 57276: And is it an infinite stream ?
25/09/20, 9:48 pm - +91 83848 69248: Yes
25/09/20, 9:48 pm - +91 76962 98890: Can you please give a pseudo code of your approach
25/09/20, 9:50 pm - +91 81696 57276: Did the interviewer say you can store the stream?
25/09/20, 9:50 pm - +91 83848 69248: Nope.
25/09/20, 9:52 pm - +91 81696 57276: So how will bs work on fly input
25/09/20, 9:52 pm - +91 87087 41206: Those who gave amazon 6 month internship test, applied directly or through referral?
25/09/20, 9:54 pm - +91 81696 57276: It can be done in constant time right?
25/09/20, 9:55 pm - +91 81696 57276: Keep a track of prev element and current ele
25/09/20, 9:57 pm - +91 81696 57276: If curr == prev-1
    count++
Else count = 1
If count >= k
    It exists
25/09/20, 9:58 pm - +91 81696 57276: As input is fly ip
We dont know what will come
So just consider previous ele
25/09/20, 10:08 pm - Rohit Pal SAC: Which platform bro??
26/09/20, 1:05 pm - +91 78958 48767: Koi ye btayega Amazon  k test vapas question p ja skte kya?

But this being my third time, I think there is a lack of threads where people can sharing their projects, and people, newbies or veterans both can look for cool projects/issues to contribute to.

Maybe a place like this exists. But I intend to start one myself, So share your projects in the comments inviting others to contribute, so everyone can find a project for themselves before Hacktoberfest starts!

27/09/20, 11:23 am - +91 70108 24101: No @916376486690 they cannot apply, since this is totally a program by DSC...

There are other programs like cloud ready facilitator, only for that they can apply, but I think the Application period is over for that..
27/09/20, 11:24 am - +91 6376 486 690: Okay Guys. Just inbox me. I will send you all details.

27/09/20, 11:42 am - +91 78148 84914: This is only for DSC?
27/09/20, 11:42 am - +91 78148 84914: Form was not public.
27/09/20, 11:42 am - +91 78148 84914: So make sure don't miss confused.

27/09/20, 11:46 am - +91 70108 24101: What do you mean?
27/09/20, 11:47 am - +91 70108 24101: Then you need to report it to Siddhant rather than following it
27/09/20, 11:47 am - +91 70108 24101: He mentioned clearly during the meeting right?
27/09/20, 11:51 am - +91 78148 84914: Don't confused:) Don't look for goodies. Go for knowledge. I had meeting by yesterday with DSC India & Google Cloud India Team. There was no such thing.

Thanks & Regards

27/09/20, 11:52 am - +91 94763 74054: So 30days of cloud is only for DSC Colleges?
27/09/20, 11:52 am - +91 70108 24101: 💯
27/09/20, 11:52 am - +91 78148 84914: Google Cloud Ready Facilitator programme is still running for that. You can checout.
27/09/20, 11:52 am - +91 70108 24101: Yes
27/09/20, 11:52 am - +91 70108 24101: This is the reason they changed the name to 30daysofcloud, to avoid confusion
27/09/20, 11:54 am - +91 78148 84914: And one more thing I would love to tell that those who have registered for Google Cloud Ready programme and if the students rejister for again #30daysonGoogleCloud programme if their college is in the DSC list. They won't get any goodies.
27/09/20, 11:55 am - +91 78148 84914: Only one will be consider. Since the prize is same for kind of similar.
27/09/20, 11:55 am - +91 78148 84914: I hope now everyone is clear with their doubts.
27/09/20, 11:56 am - +91 78148 84914: For both programmes!
27/09/20, 12:01 pm - Rohit Pal SAC: what are the things we are going to learn in this programs..
27/09/20, 12:01 pm - +91 70108 24101: And one more request guys, don't run for goodies and for the title, this is happening since the Dsc Lead Application...

Don't get me wrong, but this is bad..

Be active on LinkedIn, most of the programs are updated there...And try to apply for the same..

When you are doing something good and have intention to learn and share knowledge, things will come automatically..

And avoid spreading wrong information without clarifying which also avoid the confusion among everyone..
27/09/20, 12:02 pm - +91 78148 84914: +1
27/09/20, 12:02 pm - +91 70108 24101: If your campus don't have DSC, no problem, join GDG and contribute there
27/09/20, 12:02 pm - +91 78148 84914: +1
27/09/20, 12:04 pm - Rohit Pal SAC: Could you spend few min to clarify on this program what are things we are going to learn. ??
27/09/20, 12:08 pm - +91 70108 24101: Basically the Facilitators will help you in getting started  with Google Cloud Platform with hands-on sessions on Qwiklabs..
I am not a facilitator, so if your campus have a facilitator they will provide you more information..
27/09/20, 12:08 pm - Rohit Pal SAC: https://events.withgoogle.com/30daysofgooglecloud/program-syllabus/#content
27/09/20, 12:10 pm - Rohit Pal SAC: it going to be the online mode right not self-paced .. And we will give some free credits to explore more about the qwicklab gcp architecture and how we deployed and scale our applications just like in production envrionment..
Correct me if one wrong here.
27/09/20, 12:11 pm - +91 70108 24101: Yes, I would suggest to ask the facilitators itself, as every facilitator will have different strategy to teach..
27/09/20, 12:12 pm - +91 70108 24101: Which campus are you from?
27/09/20, 12:12 pm - Rohit Pal SAC: Okay got thanks for the clarifications.. Last question if our campus don't have the facilitator. Can we contact to other campus facilitator  and enroll in this programs.. ??
27/09/20, 12:12 pm - +91 99115 18725: how to join GDG

27/09/20, 1:01 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: thanks for sharing -- letting my superiors know. 

would recommend ignoring linkedin posts. half the time they're for personal-brand building and aren't fact-based

27/09/20, 1:05 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: thanks arnab!
27/09/20, 1:12 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: cant seem to find the original post. think he's deleted it. 

nevertheless - in all criticism lies some learning. we'll reach out to the company and find out what their concerns were, and make the appropriate fixes asap :)
27/09/20, 1:16 pm - +91 70809 74623: Yes it is deleted now.
27/09/20, 1:22 pm - +91 81696 57276: Lol i got blocked by amangoel for pointing out his mistake
27/09/20, 1:22 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: wow
27/09/20, 1:25 pm - +91 70809 74623: Aman Goel is a respected name among juniors. But calling someone idiot if they can't perform well, is not justified. If they are hired, that means they had capability to show their skills. 
And ofcourse a intern is there to learn, and can't be expected to know everything.

I think he realised his mistake and deleted the post. 
Scaler Academy and others such as Coding Ninjas etc. are really helping out students by enabling them to fulfill their dreams. :)
27/09/20, 1:27 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: yes, well said mohit :) we'll do our best!
27/09/20, 1:28 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: The founders have already reached out to Aman to find out if there's anything we can do to improve, based on his experience
27/09/20, 1:28 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: hopefully it'll come to a peaceful resolution for everyone!
27/09/20, 1:33 pm - +91 6266 884 806: Appreciable response to such criticism🙌🏻
27/09/20, 1:33 pm - +91 81378 71888: Who is Aman Goel?
27/09/20, 1:33 pm - +91 81378 71888: This message was deleted
27/09/20, 1:34 pm - +91 81378 71888: Havent heard of him
27/09/20, 1:34 pm - +91 86981 87429: The thing is we as a fresher may not know be familiar with the things required in a particular company because there are tons of technologies out there. And if the company is hiring on the basis of ds algo and cs fundamentals they should understand and give the new employee some time to get familiar with things. You cannot expect someone to get started building things in a day or so. Its just like if a student gets into iit by scoring good marks in phys chem maths.. You cannot expect him to be a great coder within a week no matter how good he is.. Just expressing my views on this
27/09/20, 1:34 pm - +91 70809 74623: He is IIT Bombay alumnus, AIR 33. See his LinkedIn profile you'll get to know
27/09/20, 1:34 pm - +91 70809 74623: One more fact, he was my senior at school
27/09/20, 1:34 pm - +91 81378 71888: Ohh

27/09/20, 1:52 pm - Varun Sridhar Scalar Academy: completely agree -- this is true for any job as as fresher, even outside software engineering
27/09/20, 1:58 pm - +91 96808 37050: Agreed.
27/09/20, 1:59 pm - +91 86004 69998: I have completed introductory lab on GCP but didn't got 600 credits

02/10/20, 9:26 pm - +91 70809 74623: But one of my friend last year did GSoC and he got an interview directly. And on Internet there was scattered information. So I thought it is the case that everyone gets an interview. My bad!!
02/10/20, 9:27 pm - +91 98998 53877: Yes, GSoC people have slight edge when there resume are shortlisted.
But the point is ki yaha jiska interview hua hai usne GSoC nahi kia hai..
02/10/20, 9:28 pm - +91 70809 74623: Accha

02/10/20, 10:34 pm - +91 87680 65252: Just want to clear his point. I had this in mind previous year. One used to get referral from Google till 2018 , few got Internship and Full Time from that.
02/10/20, 10:34 pm - +91 87680 65252: But after that Google doesn't give anything special to GSoCers
02/10/20, 10:35 pm - +91 87680 65252: They had to struggle the same, no difference is there 🙂.
02/10/20, 10:35 pm - +91 87680 65252: *after successfully completing GSoC
02/10/20, 10:36 pm - +91 81728 88421: One of my friends is a GSOCer, he didn't get any extra perks from google in test or in interviews
02/10/20, 10:36 pm - +91 76962 98890: Hn but getting an interview is a big thing in itself
02/10/20, 10:36 pm - +91 70108 24101: They have stopped giving everything since 2019 expect stipend
02/10/20, 10:37 pm - +91 70108 24101: This time they didn't give any tshirt itself
02/10/20, 10:37 pm - +91 70108 24101: And yea having GSoC in profile will add value, but not everytime..
02/10/20, 10:42 pm - +91 81728 88421: Honestly its a disadvantage too. it kinda makes you overqualified in maximum scenarios
03/10/20, 11:39 am - +91 82103 37620: Hey, 
I have completed 4 quest & 4 skill badge associated with it. I can see that it says that I have completed 8 quest. So, I want to know that Is skill badge also treated as quest & skill badge at the same time ?

03/10/20, 12:42 pm - +91 96537 00880: Approximately how much time will it take? Do u have an idea?
03/10/20, 12:44 pm - +91 93404 22023: 2 hours for each quest if you really doing it just for the goodies otherwise 60-70% of the total time mentioned in the quests

03/10/20, 12:48 pm - +91 96537 00880: 12 quests matlab 2 tracks?
03/10/20, 12:54 pm - +91 98295 99750: there is skill badge this time not quest
03/10/20, 12:54 pm - +91 93404 22023: yep

04/10/20, 12:25 pm - +91 99033 48739: Writing Bot
Problem Description
A scientist has created a Writing Bot which will read from one book and write into another. Both books may have different dimensions i.e. number of lines on each page and number of pages itself. Reads and writes also happen at different speed.

The Bot first reads from the first book fully, then processes the format to write into the second book (done instantaneously) and finally starts writing into the second book.

Your task is to identify, after a specified interval of time, if the Bot is reading or writing. For each of these activities how much read and write activity has happened needs to be captured in terms of number of pages and number of lines on the current page.

Constraints
1 <= Number of pages first book, Number of pages second book < 10^3

1 <=Number of lines in first book, Number of lines in second book < 10^2

Input
The input has 7 lines

The first line contains an integer denoting the number of pages in the first book.

The second line contains an integer denoting the number of lines per page of first book.

The third line contains an integer denoting the number of pages in second book.

The fourth line contains an integer denoting the number of lines per page of second book.

The fifth line contains an integer denoting the reading speed in lines/second.

The sixth line contains an integer denoting the writing speed in lines/second.

The seventh line contains an integer denoting the time in seconds at which the result is to be processed.

Output
On one line, print three items viz. current activity performed (READ or WRITE), page number and line number. All three items should be delimited by space.

Time Limit
1

07/10/20, 9:31 pm - +91 76962 98890: What?
07/10/20, 9:31 pm - +91 70108 24101: To remove the cgpa
07/10/20, 9:32 pm - +91 99115 18725: Yes
07/10/20, 9:32 pm - +91 99115 18725: Vese bhi cgpa is a byproduct
07/10/20, 9:32 pm - +91 76962 98890: Yes, I have removed it.
They didn't ask about in my Interview
07/10/20, 9:32 pm - +91 76962 98890: About it*
07/10/20, 9:32 pm - +91 70108 24101: Because I've seen people asking to mention anything, since recruiters won't care about it much, but yea I'm not sure.. so what would you suggest?
07/10/20, 9:32 pm - +91 76962 98890: Yes
07/10/20, 9:32 pm - +91 70108 24101: Okay cool
07/10/20, 9:32 pm - +91 70108 24101: I'll remove it then..
07/10/20, 9:33 pm - +91 76962 98890: But if your cg is low then it gets highlighted
07/10/20, 9:34 pm - +91 99033 48739: 8.9
07/10/20, 9:35 pm - +91 99033 48739: right but I have a good one .... means it would just uplift nothing wrong to keep it ? right?
07/10/20, 9:35 pm - +91 76962 98890: Yes, then it's not a issue
07/10/20, 9:35 pm - +91 76962 98890: Sure, mention it.
07/10/20, 9:36 pm - +91 95989 78416: Nvm every company form has a CGPA field . So I think its a bad idea to remove CGPA. Specially for On campus
07/10/20, 9:37 pm - +91 99033 48739: guys one more question ...... like I am from a tier 3 collage can you people like help me how to get off campus coding exams ? like for FANG companies ? any suggestions ?

07/10/20, 9:38 pm - +91 83830 06342: Ya even in my college also companies ask has minimum CGPA requirements
07/10/20, 9:44 pm - +91 81728 88421: Hey, Honestly the best way is to improve your competitive coding as much as you can. Practice as much as possible. Target the subtopics and work on your weaker parts. Wait for the opportunity and once it arrives, don't panic. Just be normal.
07/10/20, 9:44 pm - +91 77008 73795: Add courses you had completed in institute and rename side project to projects
07/10/20, 9:45 pm - +91 99931 65137: <Media omitted>
07/10/20, 9:45 pm - +91 77008 73795: This is perfect
07/10/20, 9:45 pm - +91 99931 65137: Let me know , is it is correct or I want to do any correction..
07/10/20, 9:46 pm - +91 81728 88421: Try adding skills as normal text with plain background. These type of backgrounds are generally not recognized by ATS which work on keyword based shortlisting. This might affect your chances

15/10/20, 6:02 pm - +91 83443 15137: i7 at this price point may contain lower Performance processor bro.

Thats why opting to high performance i5. Example( i5 10300H)
15/10/20, 6:02 pm - +91 78718 21036: He meant for coding and multitasking. But if you are going for UI/UX design, video editing etc. Don't choose this
15/10/20, 6:02 pm - +91 83443 15137: Yeah, only coding and multitasking between spotify and other Full-stack Development oriented applications.
15/10/20, 6:03 pm - +91 78718 21036: Then ThinkPad E14 is the best option
15/10/20, 6:03 pm - +91 78718 21036: Why do you want to go with i5 processor, why not Ryzen?

15/10/20, 9:19 pm - +91 93404 22023: Gaming laptops are just thick and heavy were as the opposite are the office laptops which usually come will less gpu power
15/10/20, 9:20 pm - +91 93404 22023: So it's just a preference if you want to keep you laptop on lap with less GPU performance or you can work off a table for that extra GPU power
15/10/20, 9:20 pm - +91 83443 15137: Oh, thanks. Got it.
15/10/20, 9:23 pm - +91 93404 22023: PS: I have an ASUS vivobook, not the most slim but enough that I can keep it on my lap, has a Nvidia MX250 which gives about 40 FPS in CSGO and 60 in Rocket league, so you can still play decent games 😌🙌

15/10/20, 9:25 pm - +91 88604 11832: guys any suggestion
15/10/20, 9:25 pm - +91 93404 22023: Touchscreen is not useful untill you are doing designing or something which can use touchscreens fully, else it's just something to showoff (pricy showoff) 😂
15/10/20, 9:26 pm - +91 83830 06342: +1
15/10/20, 9:29 pm - +91 83443 15137: Yeah, but it isn't a touchscreen one. Amazon's mistake to post it as touch screen. I crosschecked.
15/10/20, 9:32 pm - +91 93404 22023: If it isn't then it's quite costly, plus I don't think a GTX1650 is needed if you are doing simple web and Android development
15/10/20, 9:34 pm - +91 93404 22023: Also note that, 
A specific spec in gaming laptop will cost way less than that same spec in a non-gaming one mostly because it needs a powerful cooling solutions and for the looks :p
15/10/20, 9:34 pm - +91 83443 15137: Agree.
15/10/20, 9:35 pm - +91 93404 22023: Like this same spec can be had in 60K in Asus Tough series 😆
15/10/20, 9:35 pm - +91 83443 15137: With a bad display.
15/10/20, 10:11 pm - +91 99177 02467: I agree

16/10/20, 10:04 am - +91 86004 69998: and plus it is an "Make in India" Model
16/10/20, 10:05 am - +91 6375 596 557: yeah, totally agree. now because of them, many of people know that there is a word coding
16/10/20, 10:05 am - +91 81378 71888: True but I think these should not be directed towards small kids.
16/10/20, 10:07 am - +91 96537 00880: But the word now is, "yeh to bacche bhi kar lete hai" 🤦‍♂️
16/10/20, 10:08 am - +91 6375 596 557: ider 3yr k bache ko recursion nhi pata
16/10/20, 10:49 am - +91 88097 65191: I agree...

Although it has lots of negative aspect but one positive thing that i have experienced:-

Few days back my mother asked me what is this coding?
How do people do that?
Can she do coding?

I was so happy to hear the word coding from her mouth...❤️

LogN standard one
ans(u,v)=sum(u)+sum(v)-2*sum(lca(u,v))
26/10/20, 10:24 pm - +91 95989 78416: I used this
26/10/20, 10:25 pm - +91 95989 78416: I didn't use flattening
26/10/20, 10:25 pm - +91 95553 10633: how to calculate sum(u) then?

26/10/20, 10:26 pm - +91 95989 78416: sum[child]=edge[child to parent]+sum[parent]
26/10/20, 10:26 pm - +91 93404 22023: I don't think there is a cutoff, they will maybe choose top X people
26/10/20, 10:26 pm - +91 95553 10633: Ohk

04/11/20, 2:30 pm - +91 99931 65137: yes I understand. 😁
04/11/20, 2:33 pm - +91 85840 90030: First one:

MVI A 01H 
MOV B,  A
RST 3

This will store 01H to register A and then will move it to register B.
04/11/20, 2:41 pm - +91 85840 90030: For addition of two numbers :

LXI H 8000
MOV A,  M
INX H
ADD M
STA 9000

this will take a number at 8000 loc then will move it to accumulator.  Then increment the loc ... Will take another number at that loc..  Add the second no.  With the number at accumulator then will store the results at 9000 loc.
04/11/20, 2:41 pm - +91 85840 90030: For sub just use SUB instead of ADD
04/11/20, 2:42 pm - +91 99931 65137: utsav see this... is this correct for addtion..?
🤔
MOV AX, 0000h
MOV BX, 0000h
MOV AX, [2000H]
MOV BX,[2010H]
ADD AX, BX
Mov bx, [2001h]
04/11/20, 2:44 pm - +91 85840 90030: Your logic is correct but I can't say about the syntax because I am a CS student 😅
04/11/20, 2:45 pm - +91 99931 65137: okay 😅

06/11/20, 5:55 pm - +91 81378 71888: You need help with Qwiklabs??
06/11/20, 5:59 pm - Rohit Pal SAC: Nope brother actually it's real requirements for one of my project and it contains multiple container  more specifically 3 . They are communicating well locally but while deploying it has some conflict.☹️☹️
06/11/20, 6:00 pm - +91 70108 24101: One of my friends was reached out by a Recruiter from Google and got a direct invite to Interview..
06/11/20, 6:05 pm - +91 81378 71888: Really 😳
06/11/20, 6:06 pm - +91 81378 71888: I'd suggest linking with Stackdriver and see what the issue is. I mean that is why Stackdriver exist
06/11/20, 6:07 pm - +91 81378 71888: Use logging, tracer, and debugger according to the situation
06/11/20, 6:07 pm - +91 81378 71888: Also, remember to enable the Stackdriver on your Kubernetes cluster

06/11/20, 6:08 pm - +91 70809 74623: It happened in my college too. 2 girls got direct telephonic interviews, they didn't even write the rest
06/11/20, 6:09 pm - +91 70809 74623: *test
06/11/20, 6:09 pm - Rohit Pal SAC: For software developer role or cloud enginner..??
06/11/20, 6:10 pm - +91 81378 71888: Thats obvious because having such a certification will keep you stand out from the crowd. So, there is no need for a test.
06/11/20, 6:11 pm - +91 70809 74623: The Google hiring challenge which created some controversy about how only girls were preferred
06/11/20, 6:11 pm - +91 70809 74623: They don't have any. Lol
06/11/20, 6:11 pm - +91 81378 71888: What😳
06/11/20, 6:12 pm - +91 81378 71888: Then, they might be referred
06/11/20, 6:12 pm - +91 81378 71888: By Google employees
06/11/20, 6:12 pm - +91 81378 71888: That also direct goes to interview
06/11/20, 6:12 pm - +91 70809 74623: I think I missed out the context of this conversation. Having a certificate is definitely good.
06/11/20, 6:12 pm - +91 70809 74623: Are, they are my friends. No one had referral.
06/11/20, 6:13 pm - +91 81378 71888: I dont think Google calls them by random
06/11/20, 6:13 pm - +91 81378 71888: Google is not a joke, right?
06/11/20, 6:13 pm - +91 81378 71888: 😅
06/11/20, 6:14 pm - +91 81378 71888: They might have done something in relation to it
06/11/20, 6:14 pm - +91 70809 74623: Yes, I know that
06/11/20, 6:16 pm - +91 73525 70838: Through this?
06/11/20, 6:18 pm - +91 70108 24101: Certification will help to get into direct interview, but everything related to Cloud and non technical like support, associate and so on..
06/11/20, 6:20 pm - +91 70108 24101: Google employees will also reach out by looking at the projects, works, and experience, but now it's not possible as everyone started spamming of same projects what other have done..
06/11/20, 6:21 pm - +91 70108 24101: This FAANG trend, Application Cloning, "Interested" culture everything spoiled and changed the way the company used to hire people before..
06/11/20, 6:24 pm - +91 81378 71888: Well certifications are meant for those roles only...
06/11/20, 6:27 pm - +91 70108 24101: Yes, I saw a question on top asking is it for sde role..
06/11/20, 6:29 pm - +91 81378 71888: Ohh .. didnt see that one bro
06/11/20, 6:29 pm - +91 81378 71888: True bro.
06/11/20, 6:30 pm - +91 81378 71888: Because I and my female friend also gave the coding round. Ended up same number of cases. She got the interview call. I didnt
06/11/20, 6:30 pm - +91 81378 71888: 😅
06/11/20, 6:31 pm - +91 81378 71888: But I dont care. I have GCP to survive.
06/11/20, 6:33 pm - +91 76962 98890: Did you also do the Coursera specialization bro?
06/11/20, 6:34 pm - +91 81378 71888: I've completed all Google Cloud and Google courses on Coursera.
06/11/20, 6:35 pm - +91 81378 71888: Now, beta tester too.. So, I will get all the new releases even before its release. I'll get the certificate even before the course is released. 😅
06/11/20, 6:35 pm - +91 76962 98890: Ohh nicee
06/11/20, 6:36 pm - +91 76962 98890: Damn😳😳😳
06/11/20, 6:36 pm - +91 94084 73852: Kya faayda mitra....
06/11/20, 6:36 pm - +91 76962 98890: Did you also avail the discount for certification as the fees is 125$?
06/11/20, 6:36 pm - +91 94084 73852: Khel to koi aur khel gyi
06/11/20, 6:36 pm - +91 76962 98890: Hai fayda mitraa
06/11/20, 6:37 pm - +91 81378 71888: Through Google Career Readiness Program, yes
06/11/20, 6:37 pm - +91 81378 71888: 😅
06/11/20, 6:37 pm - +91 94084 73852: Will u plz tell?
06/11/20, 6:38 pm - +91 76962 98890: Kuch na hone se toh better hai bro, direct Interview ka chance bdhega
06/11/20, 6:39 pm - +91 86981 87429: Certifications matter a lot for selection
06/11/20, 6:39 pm - +91 81378 71888: I dont think Coursera will land you an interview. But it will definitely boost your confidence
06/11/20, 6:39 pm - +91 86981 87429: Just like internship experiences do
06/11/20, 6:40 pm - +91 81378 71888: At the same time, certification never guarantee that you have a good working knowledge
06/11/20, 6:40 pm - +91 81378 71888: But it is a filter when it comes to very good roles
06/11/20, 6:40 pm - +91 76962 98890: I have DL specialization certificate,it always helps me in both getting an interview as well as a talking point
06/11/20, 6:40 pm - +91 76962 98890: Yes exactly
06/11/20, 6:40 pm - +91 81378 71888: Exactly
06/11/20, 6:41 pm - +91 94084 73852: I am genuinely asking.... because I may have less idea....I have completed a lot of courses in coursera(via financial aid).... But in interview interviewers just want to know what can u actually make.. doing aside the certificate...


Its my personal experience
06/11/20, 6:41 pm - +91 94084 73852: During 1st and 2nd yr
06/11/20, 6:41 pm - +91 86981 87429: That they will check during the interviews
06/11/20, 6:41 pm - +91 76962 98890: Yea,they want to know if you really know or you are just acquiring certificates
06/11/20, 6:41 pm - +91 81378 71888: True. They only want the output. This is why I said certificates will land you an opportunity but not a job
06/11/20, 6:41 pm - +91 76962 98890: Yes
06/11/20, 6:42 pm - +91 81378 71888: Because there are a lot of people simply going behind certificates and know nothing
06/11/20, 6:42 pm - +91 86981 87429: But when it comes to shortlisting , that is done by HRs and for them certificate means thats the candidate is having that skill
06/11/20, 6:42 pm - +91 70108 24101: Come on, certificates from coursera won't help in anyways unless you build something out of it...
Many people don't understand the intention behind these programs..
06/11/20, 6:42 pm - +91 94084 73852: That's why I moved to actually learning in 3rd year inspite of collecting certificates
06/11/20, 6:42 pm - +91 81378 71888: But if the candidate doesnt know anything, they'll be rules out after the interview
06/11/20, 6:43 pm - +91 86981 87429: .
06/11/20, 6:43 pm - +91 76962 98890: Yes, obviously
06/11/20, 6:43 pm - +91 70108 24101: With coursera certificate even coursera won't give a job in their company 😂
06/11/20, 6:43 pm - +91 81378 71888: Certificates are just a document that shows you know certain things. But never a guarantee
06/11/20, 6:43 pm - +91 94084 73852: 😂😂
06/11/20, 6:43 pm - +91 76962 98890: The intention of courses are to make you learn, certificates are just a side reward
06/11/20, 6:44 pm - +91 81378 71888: Yes. A token of appreciation maybe
06/11/20, 6:44 pm - +91 95553 10633: To be honest, performing good in interview is much easier than getting an interview
06/11/20, 6:45 pm - +91 95553 10633: So many people lie on their resume just to get interview
06/11/20, 6:45 pm - +91 76962 98890: Yes,this happens
06/11/20, 6:46 pm - +91 95553 10633: Some of my friends who don't even know the syntax got the interviews in companies
06/11/20, 6:49 pm - +91 70108 24101: This is the reason why the filteration process is bad nowadays..
06/11/20, 7:16 pm - +91 90157 13383: So. You are saying if someone has a Coursera certificate he has a better chance than the one who doesn't have ?
06/11/20, 7:16 pm - +91 90157 13383: If I say about the gist of the certification talk all of you were doing above.
06/11/20, 7:17 pm - +91 90157 13383: Like I have completed courses like the Python specialisation and several others. So, should I write them on my resume or that not good.
06/11/20, 7:18 pm - +91 90157 13383: And do have Coursera certification for those so specifying them in my LinkedIn profile or my resume do have an effect while someone looks at my resume and compares it to a resume without any certification specified.
06/11/20, 7:21 pm - +91 6375 596 557: In my oppion projects will play more role
06/11/20, 7:22 pm - +91 6375 596 557: Or intership rather then any certificate
06/11/20, 7:22 pm - +91 90157 13383: Okay.
06/11/20, 7:23 pm - +91 90157 13383: If anyone else wants to share their opinion about the same. Please specify.
06/11/20, 7:28 pm - +91 86004 69998: If you are adding certificates to your resume make sure that you have made a decent project on it and handy in it
06/11/20, 7:32 pm - +91 83170 57596: As far as my experience is concerned, not even a single interviewer asked about any certificates. Instead they lay most emphasis on past internships, and then to projects.
06/11/20, 7:32 pm - +91 94084 73852: Same for me🖐️
06/11/20, 7:33 pm - +91 70809 74623: True
06/11/20, 7:35 pm - +91 77008 73795: Certificates or skills mentioned on the resume only give the new area for asking questions to the interviewer. So just mentioning skills without having practice, projects, or internship make you feel difficult.
06/11/20, 7:35 pm - +91 98712 26986: Yes, also in technical HR/Managerial round they sometimes ask 
what was your learning for which you have received this certi
06/11/20, 7:35 pm - +91 98712 26986: or what was your job (if its a internshiip certi)
06/11/20, 7:35 pm - +91 81378 71888: Exactly
06/11/20, 7:37 pm - +91 6376 486 690: It's depends upon certificate. It's not a Coursera Certificate. If you gonna crack ACE you need to have a lot practical knowledge to pass. They are not going to certify person who don't have relevant skills at all.
06/11/20, 7:39 pm - +91 83170 57596: Yeah, but mostly in the undergrad. We don't require these high level certifications, though it maybe helpful in your future jobs for some relevant positions.
06/11/20, 7:42 pm - +91 6376 486 690: Yea, actually if your employer work on GCP. They surely gonna ask you for certification and actually they will pay for it.
06/11/20, 7:43 pm - +91 6376 486 690: I work with rThreat on a contract. They people are asking me to go with certification. They gonna pay me for it as well.
06/11/20, 7:43 pm - +91 83170 57596: Yes at gojek too. They reimburse and encourage you to take courses, and expand your domain.
06/11/20, 7:44 pm - +91 6376 486 690: But my sister have 3 GCP certification and guys it really help in job improvement or may be in getting a job as well I think.
06/11/20, 8:00 pm - +91 81728 88421: https://www.glassdoor.co.in/Interview/Addverb-Technologies-Interview-Questions-E1547582.htm
06/11/20, 8:00 pm - +91 81728 88421: It was really bad interview structure and took 14 days to complete.
They made us do projects and took 5-6 interviews.They never responded in time and never joined any meeting in time as well.
Interviewing here is pure waste of time.
I would advice others not to fill this company.
DO NOT APPLY HERE.
06/11/20, 8:01 pm - +91 76962 98890: You work at gojek bro?

06/11/20, 8:08 pm - +91 83170 57596: Not due to covid, but an elective subject in last sem😕😕.
06/11/20, 8:09 pm - +91 77609 02142: Ohh
06/11/20, 11:06 pm - Rohit Pal SAC: Gojek is more focused on dev i think.

I need some help to figure out some things!
08/11/20, 6:50 pm - +91 78958 48767: Acer is not good
08/11/20, 6:50 pm - +91 86964 61658: +1
08/11/20, 7:43 pm - +91 86004 69998: in what aspect?
08/11/20, 7:43 pm - +91 86964 61658: Build quality
08/11/20, 7:43 pm - +91 86964 61658: Material used!
08/11/20, 7:43 pm - +91 86004 69998: material in the sense...?
08/11/20, 7:44 pm - +91 86004 69998: I m personally using predator helios 300 from past 1 yr I didnt got any issues with it
08/11/20, 7:46 pm - +91 86964 61658: Aspire series to be precise!
08/11/20, 7:47 pm - +91 86004 69998: then ok u r blaming the whole acer then...
08/11/20, 7:52 pm - +91 86964 61658: I was talking about this particularly
08/11/20, 7:54 pm - +91 78958 48767: Bro if you like it then you can go for it
08/11/20, 7:59 pm - +91 83830 06342: Bro I am personally using Acer aspire 5 for 3 years not a single issue . Now using aspire 7 . This model looks so premium and build quality is also good
08/11/20, 7:59 pm - +91 78958 48767: Great
08/11/20, 8:00 pm - +91 83830 06342: Acer offer Great specs at great price
08/11/20, 8:04 pm - +91 87095 19238: Okay...I'll try to make some opinions here -
1. No brand is good or bad. You prefer a brand, really, it doesn't make any sense. This is basically because most the internal components would not be made by that brand.
2. If you have ability to extend your budget by 10k, never go for intel. Go for AMD Ryzen 4th Gen.
08/11/20, 8:05 pm - +91 87095 19238: TUF A15 would be a good choice. You'll get wayyy better CPU, NVMe SSD, and Faster RAM.
08/11/20, 8:07 pm - +91 87095 19238: + U get warranty support by every brand.
08/11/20, 8:09 pm - +91 87095 19238: + if you are a Computer Science guy, you should be your own service center and make informed choices, and not go with a particular brand if people say it's good or bad.
08/11/20, 8:09 pm - +91 86964 61658: See i just know 5-6 people who bought acer aspire series in the span of last year or so and all of them faced some type of quality issue, be it keyboard or screen or anything
08/11/20, 8:10 pm - +91 86964 61658: It can't be a coincidence
08/11/20, 8:11 pm - +91 87095 19238: Which models? Also did acer say anything about the issues, did they care about their devices properly?
08/11/20, 8:12 pm - +91 86964 61658: They replaced components as well as the whole laptop in some cases
08/11/20, 8:12 pm - +91 86964 61658: but I didn't help
08/11/20, 8:12 pm - +91 87095 19238: There are multiple factors that need to go wrong for u to get an issue. In my experience, I always say - never go for reviews which don't give scientific base of why things went wrong.
08/11/20, 8:13 pm - +91 87095 19238: Also yeah, companies should start hiring better talent for service centers
08/11/20, 8:13 pm - +91 87095 19238: I'm not preferring a brand
08/11/20, 8:13 pm - +91 86964 61658: Keyboard keys not working, screen flikering issues
08/11/20, 8:13 pm - +91 87095 19238: I'm just saying, brand doesn't matter. It's the exact rog that matters.
08/11/20, 8:14 pm - +91 86964 61658: This is all about build quality!
08/11/20, 8:14 pm - +91 86964 61658: If they are providing great specs in less money then obviously they are cutting corners somewhere
08/11/20, 8:14 pm - +91 87095 19238: *rig
08/11/20, 8:14 pm - +91 86964 61658: and that's the build quality
08/11/20, 8:15 pm - +91 87095 19238: True. I agree. Companies generally cut corners somewhere, mostly in cooling and build quality
08/11/20, 8:15 pm - +91 87095 19238: But then you should be careful while using
08/11/20, 8:15 pm - +91 87095 19238: Anyways
08/11/20, 8:16 pm - +91 87095 19238: And yeah...issues occur with any and every brand
08/11/20, 8:17 pm - +91 87095 19238: Point is - do not decide not to buy a specific model if some people faced issues with the laptops in the same series
08/11/20, 8:18 pm - +91 87095 19238: Do not buy only if the exact same model and revision has known issues
08/11/20, 8:37 pm - +91 85840 90030: I have two separate files - one is for a form made by react and another one is node js file to fetch and store the form data.  Any one knows how to connect these two files?

08/11/20, 9:25 pm - +91 93404 22023: Max array length is usually 10^6 I think
08/11/20, 9:26 pm - +91 83789 92734: Considering that you are declaring the array globally
09/11/20, 12:52 pm - +91 86004 69998: can anyone suggest me some good reference books for dbms?

30/11/20, 4:29 pm - +91 81041 50837: Hey guys I am creating an android app using Android Studio on Ubuntu OS with 4GB ram. The software is not responding properly. It is taking a lot of time to build and simulate. If I am trying to run any other process, system hangs. I have disabled few useless plugins, cache is cleaned as well, but the performance is very slow. Is there any other way to get the things done quickly by speeding up the performance?
30/11/20, 4:32 pm - +91 87680 65252: Bro get a 256 GB SSD your system performance will be faster. Android Studio generally doesn't work in 4 GB RAM. It is preferred to use 8 GB RAM.
30/11/20, 4:33 pm - +91 93404 22023: Umm...let me first scream 
4GB with Andriod Studio 🤯
30/11/20, 4:33 pm - +91 81041 50837: There exist videos which tell you, you can.
30/11/20, 4:34 pm - +91 81041 50837: Okay bro
30/11/20, 4:34 pm - +91 81041 50837: On YouTube
30/11/20, 4:34 pm - +91 87680 65252: 👍🏻
30/11/20, 4:35 pm - +91 93404 22023: I mean yeah, but I don't think it is the efficient choice 😅
either upgrade the ram to 8GB or get a 128/256 GB SSD which can work as a faster secondary RAM
30/11/20, 4:35 pm - +91 70179 96586: Bro Android studio has the power to hang a 8GB ram laptop too. Then 4GB ram is getting a load of load🤔
30/11/20, 4:35 pm - +91 93404 22023: either will cost 3/4K
30/11/20, 4:36 pm - +91 81041 50837: 😂
30/11/20, 4:36 pm - +91 81041 50837: Okay 👍🏻
30/11/20, 4:36 pm - +91 93404 22023: Yeah, I had a laptop with 8GB and it used to hang on that, can't imagine how you are getting it done
30/11/20, 4:36 pm - +91 83170 57596: Yup, i had 8 gb ram on Ubuntu 18.04 even starting an emulator would hang up the system. Had to upgrade to 12 gb.
30/11/20, 4:37 pm - +91 81041 50837: Thanks for suggestions guys :)
30/11/20, 4:40 pm - +91 93404 22023: At least you are using ubuntu, otherwise windows would have also taken half of that 4GB 🤣🤣
30/11/20, 4:41 pm - +91 81041 50837: 😂

30/11/20, 5:01 pm - +91 70809 74623: Yes, good advice😂
30/11/20, 5:02 pm - +91 87501 66010: Suggested RAM for Android studio is 16 GB which is written on their website. But it works well with 8 GB as well.
It's been 3 years since I am using Android studio regularly and it works fine.
30/11/20, 5:02 pm - +91 87501 66010: 😶

02/12/20, 9:44 am - +91 80576 71678: Hello guys can anyone tell me from where i can get UI/UX practical coding questions.?
02/12/20, 9:50 am - +91 87680 65252: First of all UI is different and UX is different
UI stands for User Interface that are generally done by Graphic Designers. In order to do that you need to know tools like Adobe Photoshop, Behance, Figma etc. 

UX stands for User Experience. This part is usually done by the Front end Developers. In order to do that you need to know HTML, CSS, JS , libraries ( Reactjs and frameworks( Bootstrap, Angular).
02/12/20, 9:50 am - +91 87680 65252: In both of the things you need to have a good design mindset.
02/12/20, 9:50 am - +91 70108 24101: Preparing for siemens?
02/12/20, 9:51 am - +91 87680 65252: You can only get practical coding experience by doing some sort of projects. 
There's no alternative to get this.
02/12/20, 9:52 am - +91 70108 24101: +1, most of the companies which I have attended for interview asked me to do some tasks and they asked questions related to that only..
02/12/20, 9:52 am - +91 70108 24101: There will be no specific coding interview.. even if it is there it will be mostly related to Strings, Arrays, and sometimes matrix and trees but rare
02/12/20, 9:53 am - +91 80576 71678: Okay
02/12/20, 8:15 pm - +91 99177 02467: Hey

03/12/20, 9:06 pm - Rishi Bajpai: From the design perspective, I personally didn't liked the way icons are floating in background.
Resume section looks cool.
I mean somewhere it seems overlapping with the text.

I think adding a filter: blur(2px); would make it look better if you made it using css.

What are you using to animate the icons in the background?
I mean is it some kind of library or have you written css keyframes to animate it ?

Hope, it'll help.

17/12/20, 9:07 pm - +91 70108 24101: Some are forced to join because of their relatives studying there or something, in my college most of them joined like that only
17/12/20, 9:07 pm - +91 70108 24101: Atleast the placements should be decent enough
17/12/20, 9:09 pm - +91 70108 24101: People who literally hate engineering are the ones who joined engineering because they couldn't medical or been forced to take engineering
17/12/20, 9:10 pm - +91 83830 06342: True. 60% seats are reserved . We only have 40% seats 🙃
18/12/20, 12:31 am - +91 93404 22023: I agree, I know  a lot who got forced into this but they started enjoying the work once they got interested and were helped along the way 😌
18/12/20, 12:39 am - +91 87680 65252: Stick to one domain and be good in that don't rush to learn everything.
18/12/20, 12:39 am - +91 87680 65252: Improve problem solving skills.
18/12/20, 1:08 am - +91 81041 50837: //Assuming you want a career in tech

beConsistent { 
Learn C++, DSA -> master it (60 percent work done)

Learn a technology that you love e.g ML, Android, Web, etc. (If you have time master it) 

Enhance your communication skills

Share your knowledge

return "a great engineer"
}
18/12/20, 1:17 am - +91 87680 65252: answer in function nice 😂👏🏻
18/12/20, 1:22 am - +91 96873 83816: True!! I wish, I was known these at my first year!
18/12/20, 1:22 am - +91 81041 50837: 😂
18/12/20, 1:23 am - +91 81041 50837: I got to know this path by the end  of second year
18/12/20, 1:26 am - +91 70108 24101: Learn C++ and DSA, but why? A literal question that everyone will have in their mind, some don't even think about it, especially for someone who is not from CS background...

Everyone will have different goals, ask or help them to explore and choose the right path or domain.. ask them to learn the basics accordingly, then they can move on to optimization and DSA problems..

Basic understanding matters a lot.. many students still have no idea why they are learning DS Algo and doing competitive programming, for them, it is a way to get into good companies..

The way we share the information matters a lot..
18/12/20, 1:26 am - +91 70108 24101: Try not to give too much hype among students too
18/12/20, 1:26 am - +91 81041 50837: Bro I assumed something 🤷🏻‍♂️
18/12/20, 1:27 am - +91 70108 24101: I saw someone from second year asking for referral for a 6 years experience job in Linkedin
18/12/20, 1:27 am - +91 81041 50837: You are correct btw
18/12/20, 8:15 am - +91 86004 69998: Now I m in 3rd year but still I code graph,tress amd avl
18/12/20, 8:27 am - +91 95989 78416: But there is a problem if you are from a tier 3 college.
Opportunities are too low and competition is too high.
18/12/20, 8:50 am - +91 86004 69998: This depends on hardwork....
18/12/20, 8:50 am - +91 86004 69998: Or person to person
18/12/20, 10:22 am - +91 70108 24101: Opportunities will be there, but the college won't support or let you make use of those opportunities..
And peers won't be much supportive, you can only make use of communities to learn and gain experience..

21/12/20, 11:28 am - +91 76962 98890: Reservation based on caste is for social upliftment, there is ews category for financial upliftment.
21/12/20, 11:31 am - +91 82772 22217: Read the last paragraph
21/12/20, 11:31 am - +91 83830 06342: But the point is IAS children are also taking advantage of caste base reservation.
21/12/20, 11:32 am - +91 83830 06342: +1
21/12/20, 11:32 am - +91 83830 06342: They should change to income based only
21/12/20, 11:32 am - +91 82772 22217: Yess
21/12/20, 11:36 am - +91 76962 98890: Caste and income are different issues.
21/12/20, 11:36 am - +91 83830 06342: But to be honest this will not happen . When govt tried to rectify the SC/st act their were widespread riots by SC/st . If they remove reservation these communities will cause riots . Bcz they want to enjoy free seats
21/12/20, 11:38 am - +91 83830 06342: The why SC st pay almost no fees if they are different
21/12/20, 11:40 am - +91 82772 22217: I got in tier 3 college on my rank even belonging to ews i pay 70k per year but one having a larger rank than mine got in tier 2 college that too with 5k per year fees can u just tell me my mistake it's like a live a example
21/12/20, 11:40 am - +91 76962 98890: The reservation is not based on income, it's based on social background. Don't you know about caste based atrocities?
21/12/20, 11:42 am - +91 82772 22217: We are students what  mistake I have done to face this injustice u can 1000's like me who were not given what we deserved and we are freelancing to pay our fees
21/12/20, 11:43 am - +91 83830 06342: No I don't I read in history books only . Aise Karne lage tho mughal era mei upper caste Hindu ko bhi discrimination face Karni padhi thi. Iss logic se unko bhi benefits do

Hathras just happened. I am not talking about the past. People are still killed if they go to a upper caste temple. The discrimination is still there.
21/12/20, 11:50 am - +91 96434 55396: Guys you all are right on your surroundings and experience but they are still some of city which are well developed and most of the background are still backward in education . And the point is we still need to give time to lowe caste to level up them ... still some village where students hardly going to school .toh college jana toh sapna jaisa hota unke liye ....so we have to understand this . Yeah some loose going too good college or marks or job ....but in upper caste in 100 out of 85 will go for higher education but in lower catse they hardly complete there 10+2 reality hai ye  ...and no one will talk about this fact rather then comparing college cutt off or fees ...so keep in mind money and college will never do any justice with lower caste ...till we support that category and yes there are some drawback by the law like ...some of them came from good amd healthy background get to good college and even job too .. so you can't do with that anything .....
21/12/20, 11:52 am - +91 76962 98890: Anyway didn't mean to hurt anyone, just wanted to share my opinion 🙏
21/12/20, 11:54 am - +91 96434 55396: I know it's painful when your friends get into some good college or jobs or anything by using that category tag ..but guys we have too support that when you do it by smile or hate ...even I am in general category ... Mohit Shukla ...but I understand that facts of supporting them ....
21/12/20, 11:54 am - +91 76962 98890: +1

24/12/20, 9:53 pm - +91 88272 83571: Greetings from Scaler!
 
We hope you have been keeping yourself safe.
 
As the year is approaching an end, we thought about ending the year on a little happy learning note. And so we decided to invite one of our stellar students who braved through it all and landed up an SDE job at Amazon!
 
The story of Ahrarul Haque is one to take inspiration from. Hailing from a humble background, his journey had a fair number of obstacles to leap past. And boy he did! During his third year, he took an overnight train, traveled over 200 km to attempt a recruitment drive by Amazon, and was ultimately rejected in the last round. But he didn’t lose hope.
 
Inspired already? Get the chance to interact and ask questions directly from Ahrarul on Saturday at 4 pm for an Ask-Me-Anything session. Among other things, some of things we will talk about:
How did he prepare for the interviews?
How much did he have to practice and are there specific things to know?
What is it to work for one of the top tech companies in the world?
You can register here: https://www.scaler.com/event/how-i-got-into-amazon-live-ama-session?rcy=1&rce=270835078152
 
All registered users will have the opportunity to send in their questions beforehand and the best ones will be answered during the session.
 
If you have any questions, please feel free to drop us an email. You know we're all ears, always.
 
Here’s to learning together.

26/12/20, 1:46 pm - +91 70108 24101: It's really funny how my college trained the students that hard to get this offer 😂
26/12/20, 1:47 pm - +91 70108 24101: They could have atleast let us learn something useful
26/12/20, 1:47 pm - +91 81378 71888: We didnt have any training though
26/12/20, 1:47 pm - +91 81378 71888: Apart from a few boring classes
26/12/20, 1:48 pm - +91 70108 24101: We have in our college, since they only do mass recruitment, and they literally know my college students won't fit in any product companies, so trained the students like anything lol
26/12/20, 1:48 pm - +91 93404 22023: When are they coming though?
26/12/20, 1:48 pm - +91 93404 22023: We didn't even had that and I am happy about it :p

26/12/20, 1:49 pm - +91 70108 24101: Imagine forcing you to attend Aptitude training from 8 am to 5 pm everyday and having tests on every Saturday and Sunday..

That's what they did for us, or no permission to sit for placement 🙃
26/12/20, 1:50 pm - +91 81378 71888: I never attended any
26/12/20, 1:52 pm - +91 81378 71888: In fact, to be honest, the HR spoiled my mood by shooting questions for wearing a tshirt for the ninja interview. He wanted me to wear a formals and I said I dont have any and that I'm only comfortable in this one. Also, I didnt even answer half questions they asked. I messed up the interview on purpose. Yet they extended me an offer. I dont know if they're desperate 😅

26/12/20, 1:54 pm - +91 85840 90030: And 7 for digital
26/12/20, 1:54 pm - +91 70108 24101: Won't even cover your college fees lol
26/12/20, 1:54 pm - Rishi Bajpai: 3.36 - 3.6
26/12/20, 1:54 pm - Rishi Bajpai: 😅
26/12/20, 1:54 pm - +91 70108 24101: In our college they said 3.3
26/12/20, 2:05 pm - +91 89758 23894: No Officially its 3.36

03/01/21, 4:36 pm - +91 95553 10633: is it safe to use a device instead of emulator in android studio?
03/01/21, 4:36 pm - +91 89758 23894: Yes its totally safe
03/01/21, 4:46 pm - +91 83830 06342: Yes
03/01/21, 5:00 pm - +91 70108 24101: Emulators are used to test the application with with different device screen and specifications and people won't use it considering the safety and security part, I'm not sure what brought you this thought, anyways, using the app in device is always safer unless you have any malicious content in it, as the latest devices won't allow you to install it easily..
03/01/21, 6:23 pm - +91 95553 10633: I'm just started with Android dev, that's why I asked

03/01/21, 6:49 pm - +91 92052 56894: yes it's very safe @919555310633 ! 
it's better also specially if you are on windows with less RAM like 4 GB or so . 
emulators like genymotion or sometime freeze the system

21/01/21, 10:53 am - +91 93404 22023: There is a lot of empty space in the profile link section, maybe try aligning them side by side which might help you to add more information 😌
21/01/21, 10:53 am - +91 86004 69998: it's a prebuilt design, not possible to do that

29/01/21, 3:21 pm - +91 98998 53877: Haha..

29/01/21, 3:25 pm - +91 87680 65252: Areh there was an opening were Grace Hopper war written in top which directly indicates that so I said.

29/01/21, 4:31 pm - +91 70108 24101: Well it says Gracehopper but didn't mention anywhere that it's only for female candidates.. and even in the job description they have asked for genders.. so most probably it's open for all..
29/01/21, 4:31 pm - +91 70108 24101: And how many does actually know what Gracehopper is 😂
29/01/21, 4:32 pm - +91 87680 65252: I confirmed through a Recruiter later :)

29/01/21, 4:37 pm - +91 93404 22023: I mean they didn't clearly mentioned it if it actually is only for females (grace hopper being a female makes sense now)
29/01/21, 4:38 pm - +91 70108 24101: Yea, even they can't expect everyone to know about that conference already, atleast could have mentioned it somewhere..

04/02/21, 1:57 pm - Rishi Bajpai: <Media omitted>
04/02/21, 1:57 pm - +91 93404 22023: In simple words resume are supposed to be concise and CVs are supposed to be detailed
04/02/21, 1:57 pm - +91 70108 24101: Resume will give a brief highlight about you and your work experience..

CV will define a detailed information about you, your education, coursework, experience, projects.. etc.
04/02/21, 1:58 pm - +91 93404 22023: Hence resumes are mostly 1-2 pages and CVs can go longer than that
04/02/21, 1:59 pm - +91 70108 24101: Yes
04/02/21, 1:59 pm - +91 70108 24101: But for students, even CV is restricted to one page, atleast in India
04/02/21, 2:00 pm - +91 93404 22023: I haven't made a CV yet so yeah, I didn't knew that
04/02/21, 2:01 pm - +91 86004 69998: for freshers what should be good CV or resume?
04/02/21, 2:05 pm - +91 93404 22023: Na na, wrong question
04/02/21, 2:05 pm - +91 93404 22023: Resume is usually asked when applying for jobs and CVs when applying for academic institutions
04/02/21, 2:06 pm - +91 93404 22023: But this can vary depending on country
04/02/21, 2:06 pm - +91 93404 22023: Like European countries prefer CVs even in jobs
04/02/21, 2:07 pm - +91 93404 22023: So you have to submit whatever they ask for, you can still go ahead and submit whatever you have made but you it's better to do all you can to get that congratulations mail back and not 'Thanks for applying' 😂

04/02/21, 10:11 pm - +91 86004 69998: anyone good at UI/UX
04/02/21, 10:12 pm - +91 70108 24101: Put your queries..
04/02/21, 10:13 pm - +91 86004 69998: https://www.figma.com/proto/WN150S7HM7JpYUoX5Sp3Jq/Hackathon-Brand?node-id=1%3A2&scaling=scale-down
04/02/21, 10:14 pm - +91 86004 69998: can we call this as wireframing?
04/02/21, 10:16 pm - +91 70108 24101: This is design, wireframe is like a sketch representation of the design..
04/02/21, 10:17 pm - +91 86004 69998: can you give an example for it
04/02/21, 10:17 pm - +91 70108 24101: This is still a wireframe, you can call it as high fidelity wireframe..
04/02/21, 10:18 pm - +91 70108 24101: Just search wireframe or low fidelity wireframe
04/02/21, 10:18 pm - +91 86004 69998: is it a UX design then?
04/02/21, 10:19 pm - +91 70108 24101: UX is totally different, don't get confused with UI
04/02/21, 10:20 pm - +91 86004 69998: does wireframing comes under UI/UX?
04/02/21, 10:20 pm - +91 70108 24101: UI
04/02/21, 10:21 pm - +91 70108 24101: UX is more about study of how people react or interact to your UI design
04/02/21, 10:21 pm - +91 86004 69998: can you provide some resources for UI/UX designing or wireframing
04/02/21, 10:23 pm - +91 86004 69998: Is wireframing/UI/UX is the first stage of web designing?
04/02/21, 10:24 pm - +91 70108 24101: Low fidelity wireframe -> High Fidelity Wireframe -> UI Design -> Prototype -> Implementation
04/02/21, 10:25 pm - +91 70108 24101: I don't have anything specific.. but Google and YouTube will help a lot..
04/02/21, 10:25 pm - +91 70108 24101: Follow some design related pages on instagram
04/02/21, 10:25 pm - +91 86004 69998: is this the process of web design?
04/02/21, 10:25 pm - +91 70108 24101: Also check out dribbble.com and behance.net
04/02/21, 10:26 pm - +91 70108 24101: For better outcome, yes

10/02/21, 5:11 pm - +91 70108 24101: For cloud you have to prove that you know something about it, where we can't showcase it with our project, so we use certification, but for web, you can showcase it as project, where certificates are not at all necessary, even the recruiters won't consider it

Checkout this for educator and institute there is no need of any card. You will be get some credits points or all the free tier resources is available also.

From my opinion the educator account is of no use if we can use the aws services. We will easily found the learning resources on single google search but to get hands-on AWS services is must.
And as educator without card they don't provided i think so.

So decide according to your convenience if you want or not
20/02/21, 12:23 pm - +91 70108 24101: You will need to set upstream to keep your repo updated with the latest changes, or will face merge conflicts

25/02/21, 12:15 pm - +91 70108 24101: Make a card component first, then use map method to fetch data and feed it dynamically to the card element..
25/02/21, 12:15 pm - +91 70108 24101: Using react?
25/02/21, 12:33 pm - +91 86004 69998: Yes
25/02/21, 12:34 pm - +91 86004 69998: Will Map method will wrap  card component?
25/02/21, 12:37 pm - +91 70108 24101: Make use of props
25/02/21, 12:39 pm - +91 86004 69998: The array will be in the same file so how to use prop?
25/02/21, 12:39 pm - +91 86004 69998: and I am using functional component
25/02/21, 12:39 pm - +91 70108 24101: Create a functional component for card
25/02/21, 12:40 pm - +91 70108 24101: And use it here, add props, then in the functional component destructre the props and assign it..
25/02/21, 12:41 pm - +91 86004 69998: ok will try
25/02/21, 12:45 pm - +91 70108 24101: You can even create a seperate method to render that component and call the method anywhere
25/02/21, 12:47 pm - +91 70108 24101: You will just need to give object as parameter.. and give it to props, so no need to write the props everytime..
25/02/21, 12:55 pm - +91 86004 69998: Okay thanka

02/03/21, 12:07 pm - +91 86004 69998: what you guys think buying algoexpert is feasible?
02/03/21, 12:08 pm - +91 86004 69998: only algoexpert not systemexpert
02/03/21, 12:08 pm - +91 86004 69998: for a coder who is just between beginner and intermediate
02/03/21, 12:13 pm - +91 81041 50837: Will be good for you. But there is a lot of free quality content available on the web.
02/03/21, 12:27 pm - +91 86004 69998: I am not buying it my frnd wanted to buy it, I suggested him the same as you suggested

02/03/21, 11:57 pm - +91 70108 24101: The requirements tho 🙄😐
03/03/21, 12:25 pm - +91 86028 42290: Hey Everyone,
Me and couple of my friends are working on a project, a *WhatsApp chat analyser.*

 For that we need WhatsApp chat text files to test our website, we'd appreciate if you could *export this group's chat* and DM me the file, as *each device/user has different format of date, time, different languages in his/her phone.*

This will help us a lot! If you have any queries feel free to reach out to me.
